While the past financial \nyear  presented  a  period  of  considerable  challenge,  culminating \nin  an  overall  reported  loss,  this  phase  was  a  critical  component \nin  our  strategic  momentum.  It  allowed  us  to  intensely  focus  on \nstreamlining and aligning the DIMO group, transforming it into an \nefficiently  managed  organization  poised  for  sustainable  growth. \nThis  deliberate  recalibration  has  strengthened  our  foundations, \nenabling us to emerge more robust and resilient.\nToday, our underlying structures have been engineered to perfection; \ndesigned to help us break through adversity and soar beyond the \nchallenges of today. As we prepare to realign into a whole new \nparadigm of excellence, we're ready to revolutionize the landscape \nin which we operate and take flight into a future filled with infinite \npotential.\nDIMO.

The  kingfisher's  form  has  long  inspired  the  scientific \ncommunity for its ability to embody these very principles.

This \nisn't merely what it does, but how it does it that \ndefines its unique identity and effectiveness in \nits niche.\nSimilarly,  organizational  differentiation  is  about \nan entity's ability to stand out from competitors \nby  performing  a  core  function  or  delivering \nvalue  in  a  distinctly  superior,  more  efficient,  or \ninnovative  way.  Just  as  the  Kingfisher's  dive  is \ninstantly recognizable and signifies mastery in its \ndomain, a differentiated organization achieves a \ncompetitive advantage by offering unique value \nthat competitors struggle to replicate, making it \nthe preferred choice in its specific segment.\nCollaboration:\nOne  compelling  behavioral  characteristic  of \nthe  Kingfisher  that  exemplifies  collaboration \nin organization is the shared responsibility and \ncoordinated effort exhibited by a breeding pair \nin  building  their  nest,  incubating  eggs,  and \ncritically, in rearing their young.\nWhile  many  species  of  kingfishers  are  often \nperceived  as  solitary  hunters,  the  success  of \ntheir  progeny  relies  heavily  on  the  intricate \npartnership between the male and female. Both \nparents  diligently  work  together  to  excavate \nthe  precise  burrow  nest,  share  incubation \nduties, and tirelessly bring food to their growing \nchicks. Just as the Kingfisher parents coordinate \nseamlessly to ensure the survival and growth of \ntheir brood, organizational success in complex \nprojects,  product  development,  or  market \nexpansion  is  achieved  through  coordinated \nteamwork,  shared  accountability,  and  open \ncommunication  that  transcends  individual \nfunctions to achieve collective triumph.\nSustainability\nBy  maintaining  the  right  controls,  we \ncan  achieve  a  balanced  performance \nand  manoeuvre  through  changing \nconditions with ease. \n166  Creating Harmony – One Step at \na Time\n183 Consolidated Statement of  \nESG Performance\n184 Notes to the Consolidated  \nESG Statement\n195 GRI, ESG and SASB Assurance\nAnnexures \nWe’re  a  truly  one  of  a  kind  entity  that  is \ndesigned to adapt to a range of environments. \nWe’re built to safeguard the well-being of \nour stakeholders, capture opportunities, and \ndeliver value in the years ahead.\n244  GRI Content Index\n248 SASB Indicators\n253 SLFRS S1 & S2 Index - Early Adoption\n256 Independent Report Assurance\n257  Ten Year Summary\n258  Corporate Information\n262  Notice of Meeting\n263  Form of Proxy\nFinancial Statements\nWe  use  every  strategy  and  resource  at  our \ndisposal to move onwards, deliver progressive \nperformance and achieve success. \n155 Annual Report of the Board of Directors\n160 Directors' Interests in Contracts with \nthe Company\n162 Statement of Directors' Responsibility \nfor Financial Statements\n163 Board of Directors’ Statement on \nInternal Controls\n164 \nStatement of Responsibility of the \nChairman, Group Managing Director/\nChief Executive Officer and Chief \nFinancial Officer\n165 Independent Auditors' report\n168 Section 1 – Financial Statements\n174  Section 2 – Corporate Information\n177  Section 3 – Basis of Accounting\n184  Section 4 – Specific Accounting Policies \nand Notes"

It offers a balanced, \ntransparent, and comprehensive overview of the Group's efforts to \ncreate sustainable value for society and to enhance enterprise value \nthrough the 12 months from 01 April 2024 to 31 March 2025.\nAt DIMO, we apply a double materiality approach to provide a \ncomprehensive picture through our Integrated Annual Report. This \nfosters trust and helps stakeholders make informed decisions, \nidentifying factors that influence our ability to create or sustain value \n(financial materiality) and our impact on the environment, communities, \nand society (impact materiality) across the short, medium, and long term.\nWe integrate broader factors into our strategy and decision-\nmaking, leveraging the capital provided by stakeholders to \ndrive value. We outline our strategic objectives for the short, \nmedium, and long term, and demonstrate how we align our \noperations, resources, and impacts to achieve these goals.\nOur Integrated Annual Report goes beyond traditional \nfinancial reporting to present a holistic view of DIMO’s \njourney. It illustrates how we create, preserve, or erode \nvalue over time across the financial, social, environmental, \nand governance dimensions of our business.\nOur Approach to Developing the 2024/25 DIMO \nIntegrated Report\nThe 2024/25 Integrated Report was developed using the inputs of \nthe Board of Directors and Group Management Committee, business \nplans, performance and internal and external reporting requirements. \nA cross-functional team led by the CFO coordinated content creation, \nwith  the  involvement  of  business  and  segment  heads.

Perhaps,  this \nyear,  this  message  is  slightly  different \nin terms of the story about our financial \nachievements, as the group has made a \nloss  before  tax,  although  the  positivity \nregarding all other aspects, including the \nfuture, remain the same. \nA strong headwind \nAutomobile,  construction,  agriculture, \npower,   water   and   healthcare   are \nindustries  that  are  key  industries  on \nwhich  the  fortunes  of  the  group  rests. \nTaken individually, all these had their own \nchallenges, which may not be reflected in \nthe country’s macro-economic indicators.\nWe  completed  another  financial  year \nwithout  vehicle  imports  due  to  the \nimport  ban  on  vehicles  that  prevailed, \nthough  the  ban  was  lifted  towards  the \nend  of  the  financial  year  signalling  the \nprospects  of  an  automobile  led  growth. \nThe  collapse  of  infrastructure  related \ninvestments, consequent to the economic \ncrisis, strongly affected the construction, \npower  and  water  related  businesses \nstalling  many  projects,  resulting  in  a \nreduction  in  business  and  challenges  in \nsecuring  payments  for  work  done.  The \nrecovery  of  the  infrastructure  sector \nhas  been  rather  slow  and  has  affected \nthe businesses in this domain. This also \nmeant reduced demand for construction \nmachinery,  heavy  commercial  vehicles \nused  in  the  construction  industry  and \nother vehicles used in businesses feeding \nthe construction industry.\nThe  agriculture  inputs  business  was \na  key  contributor  to  the  loss,  with \nprofitability  severely  impacted  due  to \nerosion  of  margins  because  of  intense \nChairman's multilingual Video, \nAudio and PDF about the \nfinancial year.\nhttps://www.dimolanka.\ncom/2024-2025-dimo-\nannual-report/url.php?id=5\nThe indications are that the company will \novercome the challenges and obstacles it faced \nand be on its course towards profitability and \ngrowth in the ensuing year.\nAs we move forward, we remain focused on our core strategy \nand are committed to driving growth across our portfolio. \nOur efforts to diversify, differentiate, and collaborate will \ncontinue to be the cornerstone of our approach.\nDIMO at a Glance  \n|\n  Management Commentary  \n|\n  Enterprise Governance  \n|\n  Sustainability  \n|\n  Financial Statements  \n|\n  Annexures\n11MOMENTUM IN MOTION"

Changes   in   weather   patterns   \ntoo  prompted  disposal  of  stocks  at \nlower margins to avoid a stock build up. \nInvestments  in  the  agriculture  segment, \nincluding  the  investments  in  agriculture \nrelated  exports,  too  contributed  to  the \nloss  for  the  year,  with  revenue  streams \nfrom  these  investments  being  delayed \nmore than expected. \nHealthcare segment, a good part of which \nis fed by bio-medical equipment, similarly \nexperienced a severe lack of demand from \nthe  government  sector  as  well  as  the \nprivate sector.\nImpact of New Investments on \nPerformance\nDuring  the  past  few  years,  we  made \nstrategic   acquisitions   or   entered \nstrategic new ventures. Majority of these \ninvestments  were  Agriculture  segment \nrelated. One of the main reasons for our \nforay  into  Agriculture  based  expansions \nwas  to  consolidate  the  agriculture \nbusiness  by  increasing  our  footprint  in \nthe domain, and to enhance our presence \nin  Agri  inputs,  value  addition  and  Agri \noutputs. This included exports as well, in \nline with our strategic priorities. However, \nmost  of  these  investments  took  longer \nthan  anticipated  to  generate  envisaged \nrevenues. These delays too contributed to \nthe loss made for the year. The increase \nin coconut prices was another factor that \nadversely affected our ventures in virgin \ncoconut  oil,  coconut  milk  and  charcoal \nproduction businesses. \nCollection  of  trade  receivables  was  an \nadded  concern,  which  perhaps  was  led \nby  the  recent  economic  crisis,  though \nimprovements were noticed towards the \nlatter part of the financial year.\nStrategic Direction\nWe  continue  to  pursue  diversification, \ndifferentiation  and  collaboration  as  the \nStrategic  Pillars  for  growth.  Technology, \nPeople  and  Sustainability  are  three \nareas through which these strategies are \nbrought to life.   \nLooking Inwards\nAgainst a background of many adversities. \nour key segments were able to produce \npositive results only to be totally offset by \nlosses  made  in  the  agriculture  segment \nand a few other businesses. \nDuring the toughest times, the group was \nable to sail through, partly due to revenue \nstreams  produced  by  relatively  new \nbusinesses  such  as  agricultural  inputs, \nthough same could not be said about the \nfinancial year 2024/25, due to the reasons \nexplained.  With  strategic  adjustments \nmade  to  our  approach,  the  agriculture \ninputs  business  is  expected  to  perform \nwell in the ensuing year.\nThe  prolonged  vehicle  ban  made  us \nrationalise our investments in automobile \nbusiness,  in  some  cases  discontinuing \na  few  of  the  customer  interaction \npoints  spread  over  the  country.  With \nvehicle imports being permitted, we are \nconsidering improving our footprint in this \nsegment. The Agri machinery businesses \nled  by  tractors  and  harvesters  boosted \nthe produced satisfactory results showing \ngood  prospects  for  the  future.  We  are \nclosely watching the developments in the \nautomobile market, and are ready to face \nchallenges such eventualities may bring \nabout.\nIn  terms  of  geographical  diversification, \nwe could see our construction machinery \nbusiness in Bangladesh maturing to take \nits  due  place  in  the  market.  We  have \nalso  mapped  our  future  footprint  in  the \nEducation  segment  and  the  first  steps \nwill shortly be taken for expansion, when \nwe re-locate Dimo Academy for Technical \nStudies  (DATS)  to  a  more  convenient \nlocation with increased capacity.\nThe  Healthcare  segment  has  acquired \na    well-rounded    portfolio    during    the    \npast  few  years  through  acquisitions \nand diversification. The company is also \nseeking aggressive medium-term growth \nin  the  pharmaceutical  business  through \nour recently acquired two subsidiaries.\nTechnology Transformation\nIn  alignment  with  our  strategic  focus \non   innovation   and   efficiency,   the \nimplementation  of  SAP  marked  a \nsignificant  milestone  in  our  journey \ntowards  digital  transformation.  This \nadvanced  enterprise  resource  planning \nsystem  helped  to  further  streamline \nour  operations,  enabling  us  to  integrate \nprocesses  across  all  business  segments \nmore  effectively.  By  embracing  SAP’s \ncapabilities,  we  have  enhanced  data \nvisibility,   improved   decision-making, \nand strengthened our ability to respond \nswiftly to market dynamics.\nThe adoption of SAP positions our company \nto  confidently  navigate  the  complexities \nof  today’s  rapidly  changing  business \nenvironment. As a key enabler, it allows \nus to keep pace or stay ahead of industry \ntrends and compete in the marketplace. \nThis  transformation  underscores  our \ncommitment to leveraging technology as \na cornerstone of growth, ensuring that we \nremain adaptable and resilient in the face \nof future challenges.\nOur People\nTraditionally, DIMO has been a company \nthat  has  relied  heavily  on  its  people  to  \nsucceed.  Over  the  years  we  have  been \ninvesting in our employees to deliver on \nthis expectation. I am happy to inform you \nthat  DIMO  was  recognised  as  a  “Great \nPlace to Work” for the 13th consecutive \nyear,  during  the  financial  year  under \nreview. \nSustainability\nSustainability   has   emerged   as   a \ncornerstone of modern business success, \nshaping  the  way  companies  operate, \ninnovate,    and    grow.    For    DIMO,    the    \ncommitment to sustainability is not only an \nethical imperative but also a strategic one. \nCHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"

Yet, we emerge \nfrom it stronger, having laid the foundation \nfor sustainable transformation.\nThis    year    unfolded    against    ongoing    \neconomic  instability.  Although  2024 \nshowed signs of macroeconomic recovery, \nreflected in sectors such as tourism and \nconstruction,  overall  household  income, \nemployment, and general welfare levels \nremained  below  pre-crisis  standards. \nThe  national  poverty  rate  stayed  high,  \nand  these  socioeconomic  challenges \ndirectly affected our markets, particularly \nvehicle  sales.  While  the  lifting  of  the \nvehicle  import  ban  offered  some  relief, \nhigh  import  tariffs  continued  to  impact \naffordability and demand.\nDespite  these  conditions,  we  remained \nfocused  on  long-term  value  creation. \nWe  advanced  structural  reforms,  digital \ntransformation,   and   future-focused \ninitiatives,  reaffirming  our  resilience \nand  commitment  to  stakeholder  value. \nGroup MD/ CEO Multilingual \nVideo, Audio and PDF about the \nfinancial year.\nhttps://www.dimolanka.\ncom/2024-2025-dimo-\nannual-report/url.php?id=7\nThough  we  report  a  financial  loss  this \nyear,  we  take  pride  in  the  meaningful \ngroundwork  put  in  during  the  year  to \nensure  sustainable  growth  in  upcoming \nyears.

Our   team’s \ndedication  ensured  the  stabilization  and \noptimization of Phase 1. We look ahead to \nlaunching Phase 2 of the ERP in 2025/26. \nThis next phase will introduce a suite of \nvalue-adding  functionalities  to  enhance \nthe  experience  of  both  our  internal  and \nexternal stakeholders.\nIn  parallel,  we  embarked  on  several \ndigitalization  projects  across  internal \noperations   to   strengthen   controls, \nenhance  efficiency  and  ensure  real-\ntime  data  accuracy,  and  improve  the \nstakeholder  experience.  A  dedicated \ntransformation  team  now  partners  with \nbusiness  units  to  drive  digital  and  AI-\nled innovation initiatives from which we \nanticipate tangible benefits in the coming \nyear and beyond.\nYear of resilience and building for \nfuture\nThe  economic  tide  began  to  turn  in  the \nlatter part of the financial year, marked by \na recovery in construction activity and the \nlifting of the vehicle import ban. While the \nfull impact of these developments will be \nrealized in FY 2025/26, our performance \nthis  year  reflects  the  resilience  and \nperseverance of our teams.\nDespite constrained market conditions, the \nMobility segment posted higher financial \nperformance during the year compared to \nthe preceding year. Leveraging our local \nvehicle assembly operations and strategic \nimport allowances, we continued to meet \ncustomer  needs  and  kept  operations \nactive  even  during  vehicle  import \nrestrictions.  The  recent  introduction  of \nelectric  vehicles,  positions  this  segment \nwell to support our Group’s sustainability \nagenda and deliver improved performance \nin the upcoming year.\nThe  Automotive  Engineering  Solutions \nSegment  remained  a  cornerstone  of \nGroup  performance,  generating  the \nhighest  contribution  to  Group  PBT  for \nthe  year.  Beyond  financial  results,  we \nfulfilled  critical  fleet  maintenance  needs \nof  our  valued  customers  during  the \nvehicle  import  ban  where  they  did  not \nhave  access  to  renewing  their  fleet,  yet \nrequired  cost  efficient  fleet  operations, \nthereby reinforcing our value proposition. \nThe education division within the segment \ngained   traction,   offering   vocational \npathways  for  youth,  and  expansion  is \nplanned for FY 2025/26.\nThe Retail segment, although challenged \nby  reduced  household  spending  and \nmargin pressure, recorded higher financial \nperformance during the year compared to \nlast year. Growth was led by the revenue \nstreams  of  Automotive  Parts  and  Tyres, \nwhile many revenue streams were under \npressure  on  performance.  The  segment \nunderwent  structural  changes  and  re-\nalignment  of  the  sales  operation  to \nalign  with  the  current  market  demands.  \nStrategic  supply  chain  realignment  and \nprocess  improvements  are  expected  to \nyield  stronger  results  in  the  upcoming \nyear.  The  Chemical  Solutions  arm  of \nthe  segment  plans  growth  in  terms  of \nfinancial  performance  and  sustainable \nproduct innovations in different avenues \nwithin the chemical solutions domain.\nDespite  a  turnover  increase  during  the \nyear,  the  Agriculture  segment  posted  a \nnegative contribution to the Group Profit \nfor the year, impacted by adverse climatic \nconditions  and  severe  price  competition \naffecting  Agri  inputs  revenue  streams. \nNonetheless,  further  investments  were \nmade  in  capital  expenditure  during  the \nyear on new initiatives, Agri Technology \nand  improvements  within  the  segment, \nappreciating the potential of this industry, \nportfolio  strategies  of  the  group  and  the  \nsustainable  contributions  to  the  group \nand  the  industry.  We  have  stepped  in  to  \nthe export market during the year with our \nlocally  produced  value-added  products, \nand  forward  to  seeing  this  area  taking \npositive  turns  during  25/26.  We  remain \nconfident  in  this  sector’s  future  and  are \ncommitted to unlocking its full potential in \nFY 2025/26 and beyond.\nWith  the  construction  sector  regaining \nmomentum, the Infrastructure Engineering \nSegment is poised for revival. The pipeline \nfor FY 2025/26 reflects renewed optimism \non the performance of this segment.\nThe  Health  Care  Segment  encountered \nheadwinds  with  reduced  demand  for \nmedical equipment. Efforts are underway \nto  revitalise  performance  across  the \npharmaceutical    and    consumables \nstreams.\nPower       Engineering       and       Building       \nTechnologies Segment took a major step \nin  the  renewable  energy  arena  during \nthe year whilst contributing as a strong \nperformer  within  the  Group.  Apart  from \nthe major projects that are undertaken in \npower engineering and building solutions, \nthe  renewable  energy  portfolio  gained \nsignificant  traction,  contributing  both \nfinancially  and  toward  our  long-term \nsustainability goals. \nWe  are  confident  of  our  plans  for  the \nensuing year and are looking forward to \nseizing  market  opportunities  to  bounce \nback  strong  with  our  initiatives  and  the \nmomentum  built  up  this  year  in  each \nsegment,  and  thereby  grow  our  Group \nfinancial performance positively.\nOperational Focus\nReflecting on our performance during the \nyear under review, we have identified key \noperational  areas  that  warrant  targeted  \nattention  and  action  in  the  upcoming \nyear.   Margin   management,   working \ncapital  optimisation,  and  optimising  new \nstructures and processes for overhead cost \nmanagement have emerged as operational \npriorities       to       strengthen       operating       \nprofitability  and  cash  flow  management, \ncomplementing  our  growth  ambitions. \nDedicated  teams  have  been  aligned  to \ndrive initiatives in these focus areas."

Why 'Diversifying Business Domains' matters as a strategic priority for DIMO\nDiversification\nFor decades, DIMO was \nestablished, and thrived, as an \n'Automobile' company.\nHowever, the need to diversify \ninto more business domains was \nidentified at the peak of success \n- driven by the volatility of the \nbusiness environment and the \ncontinuous emergence of new \nopportunities.\nAccordingly, it was sought to \nreduce the dependency on a \nsingle business domain to ensure \noptimal, consistent and continuous \nutilisation of all capitals for \nsustainable value creation in the \nmedium and long-term.\nDIMO has successfully expanded \ninto seven different segments to \ndate.\n Refer page 35 to read more \non our segments\nDuring the year under review, \nDIMO made notable progress \nin diversifying its portfolio \nthrough strategic entry into the \nsolar energy sector. Two solar \npower plants were successfully \ncommissioned, while five \nadditional plants are currently \nunder construction, reinforcing our \ncommitment to sustainable and \ninnovative energy solutions.\nMedium to Long term \nStrengthen the presence in the \nAgriculture domain, becoming \na key partner of growth for the \nfarming community and the \nagricultural industry of Sri Lanka. \nOperational \nRisk\nStrategic \nRisk \nFinancial \nRisk\n High\nFCMC\nHCSRC\nICNC\nLong Term \nFurther expand the power and \nenergy division to support national \nenergy objectives.\n Refer page 52 to read more \non power engineering solutions\nDevelop a resilient portfolio of \nproducts and services to navigate \ncrisis periods, ultimately driving \nlong-term revenue diversification \nand delivering shared value to all \nstakeholders.\n2.  Why 'Expanding Essential Presence’ matters as a strategic priority for DIMO\nDiversification\nThe volatile and uncertain nature \nof both the local and global \nmarkets in the recent past, caused \nby many economic, political, \nenvironmental and social dynamics \nand extreme conditions has \ndemonstrated the benefits of being \npresent in the essential goods and \nservices domain as well as the \nbenefits of expanding geographical \npresence.\nDIMO identified this requirement \nas being of strategic importance \nand hence identified the need to \nengage with sectors that have \nconsistent demand, including \nagriculture, food and beverage, \nenergy, education and healthcare. \nThis approach ensures stability \nand resilience during economic \ndownturns.\nDIMO has undertaken efforts \nto expand its education arm \nby investing in a new facility in \nPeliyagoda.\nIn healthcare, our partnership with \nVarian, a Siemens Healthineers \ncompany, is advancing access to \ncutting-edge cancer treatment \nin Sri Lanka—reinforcing our \ncommitment to national priorities \nand improving lives through critical \nservices.\nIn Agriculture, DIMO ventured in \nto the export business during the \nyear.\nMedium to Long Term \nFocus on agricultural exports and \nagricultural consumer products \nto establish a stronger presence \nin the essential goods domain \nto generate consistent revenue \nstreams. \nProvide expanded services and \nenriched experience towards \nvocational education, with a view \nto strengthening employability \nof our youth both locally and \ninternationally, whilst improving \nfinancial performance of the \neducation business stream.\nStrategic \nRisk \nOperational \nRisk\nFinancial \nRisk\nCompliance \nRisk\n High\nFCMC\nHCSRC\nICNC\nLong Term \nFurther strengthen the healthcare \nconsumer segment by onboarding \nnew businesses and cultivating \nstrategic partnerships.\nStrategy & Resource \nAllocation Section\nhttps://www.dimolanka.\ncom/2024-2025-dimo-annual-\nreport/url.php?id=10"

While Sri Lanka’s economy stabilized post-\ncrisis, supply chain realignments, movements in interest rates and exchange \nrates and accelerating demand for green technologies, reshaped our priorities. \nThis section explores how DIMO confronted these challenges to move \nforward and at times turning them into catalysts for innovations and new \nopportunities facing and how macroeconomic forces and technological shifts.\n1.   Macroeconomic forces shaping the business\nTable 05:\nKey economic indicators20242023\nGDP growth 5.4(2.3)\nInflation as of March(1.7)4.0\nYear-end exchange rate (Rs/USD)292.58323.92\nAWPLR (%)11.9312.13\nFiscal deficit (% of GDP)(6.8)(8.3)\nExternal debt (% of GDP)5865\nUnemployment rate %5.24.7\nGlobal Economy\nThe  year  2024  presented  a  complex  global  economic  picture. \nWhile inflation eased in advanced economies, persistently high \ninterest rates tightened capital flows to emerging markets such \nas Sri Lanka. \nGeopolitical  Dynamics: Geopolitical tensions such as Red Sea \nshipping crisis and US-China trade decoupling disrupted supply \nchains, elevating costs for imported machinery and auto parts. Yet \namid these headwinds, some transformative trends such as the \ntransition to renewable energy opened doors for us in the local \nmarket to deliver cutting-edge solar solutions. According to the \nInternational Renewable Energy Agency, renewables accounted \nfor over 90% of total global power expansion in 2024, with 585 \nGW of capacity added. \nSri Lanka’s economic recovery \nDuring the year 2024, Sri Lanka’s economy reflected a measured \nrecovery,  with  GDP  growth  reaching  2.3%  (CBSL)  after  three \nconsecutive  years  of  contraction.  Key  indicators  signalled \nstabilization:\nMonetary  Policy: Currently in deflation, inflation is expected to \nshift into positive territory and gradually move toward the 5% \ntarget in the next financial year.\nIn  2024,  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (CBSL)  made  several \nchanges  to  its  policy  interest  rates,  highlighting  a  notable \nreduction in July and the introduction of a single policy interest \nrate in November.\nFiscal Stability Improves Under IMF Program: The International \nMonetary Fund’s Extended Fund Facility (IMF-EFF) program (USD \n2.9 billion) and debt restructuring progress helped restore fiscal \nstability, though public debt remained elevated at 101.8% of GDP.\nExchange  rate  dynamics: During the financial year 2024/25 Sri \nLankan rupee (LKR) stabilized but remained volatile, averaging \n295–305 per USD which is a significant improvement compared \nto the financial year 2023/24. \nExternal  Sector  Strengthens:  Worker  remittances  reached  to \n$6.5 billion (CBSL) a 10% increase compared to the year 2023. \nAnd tourist arrivals surpassed 1.4 million (Sri Lanka Tourism). \nImpact to DIMO & Our response\nThe  positive  GDP  growth  boosted  consumer  and  business \nconfidence,  leading  to  a  construction  rebound  and  increased \nopportunities in renewable energy, including through strategic \npartnerships. \nThe Group’s interest expenses benefit from the declining market \ninterest rates; the reduced borrowing cost was an enabling factor \nfor investments in new businesses.\nThe  appreciation  of  the  Sri  Lankan  rupee  during  the  year \nlowered import costs, partly offsetting the rising indirect taxes, \nand  supported  competitive  pricing  and  consumer  spending. \nAdditionally, the reduced cost of imported capital goods which \nis a key component of DIMO’s portfolio, strengthened our ability \nto deliver value to customers while maintaining healthy margins.\nDiversify Business  \nDomains\nManage Climate Risk\nExpand Essential \nPresence\nDeepen Key Partnerships\nStrategic Priorities\niii\nixvi"

During the year, special permits were issued \nfor importation of vehicles to be used in tourism. Additionally, the government-issued \nremittance permits, allowing vehicle purchases to be made based on foreign currency \nremittance.  A  few  players  continued  with  limited  numbers  of  assembled  vehicles  of \nselected model ranges being released to the market. However, the opening of the market \ndid not bring in the expected level of enthusiasm and activity in the market, owing to the \nhigh duty structure which made prices less attractive and affordable to the market.\nHow We Performed\nDespite  operating  during  a  period  of  restrictions  on  motor  vehicle  importation,  the \nsegment financials exceeded budgets, positively contributing to the group result. In the \npersonal mobility arena, keeping the trust and confidence our customers have placed on \nus, DIMO continued the “DIMO-Certified” vehicle sale enabling the customers to sell their \nvehicles to as well as buy a vehicle from, a trusted establishment. Customers were also \noffered an innovative option of converting their vehicle into an investment with a return \nthrough the “Carpital” initiative. Additionally, the remittance permit enabled the sale of \n25 Mercedes Benz electric vehicles during the year. \nIn Commercial Mobility, DIMO continued the assembly of the TATA Ace light commercial \nvehicle and the TATA Yoda single cab, totalling 289 units, providing some much-needed \ntraction  amidst  government  restrictions.  Addressing  the  tourism  market  through  the \nvehicle permits for tourism, DIMO supplied three EQV, luxury electric vans for tourism \nservice providers in Sri Lanka. DIMO has also placed orders for several luxury Mercedes \nBenz buses which are expected to be delivered to the customers in the coming year. \nAddressing the requirements of the commercial vehicle sector, the business supplied \n147 TATA prime movers, thus contributing to the logistics sector of the country. \nReestablish the Mercedes Benz brand \nas the pinnacle of luxury mobility \nand make TATA passenger vehicles \nsynonymous in the automotive \nsegment in the next 2 to 3 years. \nInstitutionalise the TATA commercial \nvehicle as best in class in Sri Lanka. \nBe a catalyst for the luxury tourism \ntransportation sector and increase our \nfootprint globally.” \nRajeev Pandithage\nExecutive Director\nGraph 01: Mobility segment revenue \ncontribution to the Group\nMobility Video\nhttps://www.dimolanka.\ncom/2024-2025-dimo-annual-\nreport/url.php?id=12\nMOBILITY\nBUSINESS REPORTS\n7%\n2023/24\n7%\n2024/25"

However,  dedicated  to  the  country’s \ncommitment to source 70% of energy from clean energy sources by 2030, the government \nexpanded its capacity of solar power generation by opening the market to Independent \nPower Producers.  The building solutions sector also reflected reduced activity, with only \na few large projects getting off the ground, such as the Harbour Village project by Access \nEngineering, Galadari Hotel  and several new shopping mall projects. \nHow We Performed\nIn spite of a market recession in the sector, DIMO continued to collaborate with the Ceylon \nElectricity Board for its grid maintenance activities throughout the year. The segment also \nfaced occasional demand for the supply of ‘Transformers’ and ‘Gas Insulated Switchgear’. \nDiversifying the product portfolio, DIMO launched the production of type tested panels \nin the previous financial year. Production and sale of these panels successfully continued \nthroughout the year. Pursuing market development opportunities, the company crossed \ninternational borders for the installation of elevator systems at the Male international \nairport. \nOur key focus for the immediate future \nis to continue expanding our footprint \nin renewable power generation, while \ndrawing special attention to Energy \nStorage. We are actively engaging in \ngrid infrastructure development projects \nby introducing the latest technology \nfrom our world-leading Principals in \nthe Power & Energy space.

The  medical  devices  segment  experienced \nconsistent expansion with the market, estimated to be valued at approximately LKR \n85 billion in 2024, anticipated to escalate to LKR 147 billion by the year 2030, thereby \nindicating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.3%. Furthermore, the market for \nhospital equipment and supplies also witnessed growth, invigorated by investments \ndirected towards healthcare infrastructure and modernization initiatives. The demand \nfor sterilization apparatus, disposable supplies, and diagnostic instruments amplified. \nIn  the  pharmaceutical  domain,  the  market  valuation  approximated  LKR  625  billion \nin  2024,  accompanied  by  a  modest  CAGR  of  1.6%.  The  government’s  emphasis  on \nlocalizing pharmaceutical production to satisfy half of the domestic requirement by 2024 \nsignificantly contributed to this growth. \nHow we Performed\nThe Capital Equipment sector, bolstered by DIMO’s portfolio of diagnostic imaging and \nsurgical as well as critical solutions, maintained substantial revenue flows during the \nyear. In the devices sector, particularly cardiac devices, several uncontrollable challenges \nat the State Pharmaceutical Corporation (SPC) and the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) \nadversely  impacted  volume.  The  team's  prompt  response  facilitated  the  attainment \nof performance objectives. The Pharmaceuticals segment encountered a multifaceted \nenvironment characterized by rigorous price regulations, global supply chain disruptions, \nand  a  disjointed  purchasing  process  involving  prescribers,  patients,  and  chemists. \nNonetheless,  strategic  channel  management  and  portfolio  optimization  empowered \nDIMO Pharma to achieve both net profitability and sustained growth momentum.\n'Our aspiration is to establish ourselves \nas a premier manufacturer and the \nforemost agency for our principals \nwithin the field of medicine.

Electric \nvehicles (EVs) are at the forefront of this \nshift, contributing significantly to reduced \ngreenhouse gas emissions and decreased \nfossil  fuel  dependency,  thus  aligning \nwith  multiple  Sustainable  Development \nGoals  (SDGs).  However,  EV  adoption  is \nnot  without  its  challenges,  particularly \nthe  environmental  impacts  of  battery \nproduction, disposal, and recycling. \nDIMO conducted an economic feasibility \nstudy on EV battery recycling in Sri Lanka \nduring the year. This research focused on \nthe critical factor whether an EV Battery \nrecycling factory was a feasible solution \nfor Sri Lanka. \nWe  worked  in  partnership  with  the \nMercedes  Benz  EV  battery  recycling \nfacility  in  Kuppenheim  and  created  a \nglobal  list  of  EV  recycling  companies.  It \nwas determined that establishing an EV \nrecycling facility with a 2,500 tonne/year \ncapacity  in  Sri  Lanka  would  involve  an \nestimated CapEx of LKR 8.9 billion while \nannual  operations  were  estimated  that \nto involve LKR1.9 billion of OpEx. A gross \nprofit  of  2.85  billion  LKR  was  projected \nannually but upon considering the cost of \nacquiring feedstock (EoL batteries or black \nmass), it was estimated to produce a net \nloss. A much larger scale facility might be \nprofitable if there is a constant supply of \nfeedstock at a lower cost.\nTherefore,  even  though  EV  battery \nrecycling  may  seem  not  viable  for  Sri \nLanka at present, such projects would be \nbeneficial as the island evolves to embrace \nElectric  Vehicles.  Such  initiatives  should \nbe  fuelled  through  fuelled  through  the \ncollective efforts and assistance from the \ngovernment,  corporates  and  the  public, \nleading Sri Lanka towards a sustainable \nfuture.\nHighlights 24/25\n yESG Highlights  (page 168 to 171)\n yESG Statement  (page 183 to 194)\nOur Strategic ObjectivesKey InitiativesJourney So Far\n yReducing  Carbon  Emission  by \n50% (2019 Baseline)\n y100% Reuse of Treated Water\n yZero Landfill\n y1:1 Restoration\n ySBTi Target Setting & Decarbonization \nPlan\n yInventory  of  ETP  Facilities/Improving \nTreatment & Reuse\n yWaste Mapping & Sustainable Disposal\n yProject 'Life' in Kanneliya\n yMangrove Restoration in Galle\n yMarine Turtle Conservation in Panama\n yInvasive Flora Removal in \nLunugamvehera National Park \n ySBTi  Commitment  &  DIMO \nDecarbonization Plan\n yReusing in 4 Facilities for Vehicle \nUndercarriage \n yImplementation  of  Single-use \nPlastic Policy & PET Collection & \nRecycling in Facilities\n yContinuation   of   Restoration   &   \nConservation Projects\n yDIMO  Nature  Club  Volunteer \nActivities\nReimagining DIMO: Environment Pillar – DIMO Sustainability Agenda 2030"

The rationale behind the selected scenarios and timeframes reflect DIMO’s \ncommitment to sustainable business practices and takes into consideration potential \nfuture developments in Sri Lankan rules and regulations. \nScenario Analysis\nDIMO has adopted a three-scenario approach to climate projections for climate risk \nassessment and reporting purposes. These scenarios are based on the Representative \nConcentration  Pathways  (RCPs)  developed  by  the  Intergovernmental  Panel  on \nClimate Change (IPCC). For ease of reporting and to support the risk management \nprocess, DIMO has aligned its climate scenarios with RCP 8.5, 6.0, 4.5, and 2.6 in the \nfollowing manner:\n yRCP 8.5 – Business-as-usual scenario (BAU)\n yRCP 6.0 & 4.5 – Intermediate scenario\n yRCP 2.6 – Low carbon scenario\nTime Horizons\n yShort – 1 to 5 years\n yMedium – 6 to 10 years\n yLong – 11  to 2050\nDIMO’s  approach  to  identifying  climate-\nrelated  risks  and  opportunities  aligns \nwith  its  conventional  risk  management \nstrategy.    During    the    preparation    of    \nthe  risk  registry  (Refer  page  106),  all \npotential  climate-related  physical  risks \narising under a Business-as-Usual (BAU) \nscenario  are  identified  alongside  other \noperational and strategic business risks. \nA  segment-wise  Climate-Related  Risks \nand Opportunities (CRRO) assessment is \nconducted by the core risk management \nteam,  with  technical  guidance  from  the \nGroup Sustainability Team. Each business \nsegment  undergoes  further  evaluation \nthrough  climate  scenario  analysis  over \nthe  short,  medium,  and  long  term  and \nmaterial risks are identified and presented \nin  the  business  reports  (Refer  business \nreports 36 to 63).\nDIMO’s  climate  strategy  is  embedded \nwithin  the  broader  DIMO  Sustainability \nAgenda  2030,  which  focuses  on  both \ngreening  the  business  portfolio  and \nreducing  the  Group’s  overall  carbon \nfootprint.\nGreening Business Portfolio\n yEV focus\n yRenewable energy business expansion\n ySustainable agriculture \n yCollaborative approaches with \nprinciples and suppliers\nGHG emission reduction\n yComprehensive emission inventory\n y1.5\n0\nC Near-term science-based \ntargets \n yDIMO Decarbonization plan\n yValue stream focus"

This  collaborative  process \nsupports the development of appropriate \nmitigation strategies and the identification \nof  climate-related  opportunities.  All \nclimate risks are categorized in alignment \nwith  the  frameworks  provided  by  the \nTask  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial \nDisclosures (TCFD) and IFRS S2 standards.\nUnder both TCFD and IFRS S2 guidelines, \nclimate  risks  are  classified  into  two \nprimary   categories:   physical   risks \nand  transition  risks.  These  are  further \nsubdivided  into  two  subcategories  for \nphysical  risks  (acute  and  chronic)  and \nfour  subcategories  for  transition  risks \n(policy and legal, technology, market, and \nreputational).\nClimate-related  physical  risks  were \nidentified  through  a  comprehensive \nprocess involving the analysis of national \nnatural  disaster  vulnerability  maps, \nnational  climate  projections,  and  cross-\nfunctional  brainstorming  sessions  held \nduring   risk   management   meetings. \nTransition  risks,  along  with  scenario \nanalyses, were identified based on global \nclimate  projections  (RCPs),  anticipated \nmarket  shifts,  projected  international \npolicy  developments,  and  Sri  Lanka’s \nNationally   Determined   Contributions \n(NDCs), also through cross-functional risk \nassessment discussions.\nAs a responsible organization, DIMO is committed to minimizing its impact on natural \ncapital, and the DIMO Sustainability Agenda 2030 ensures continuous efforts to reduce \nthe  environmental  footprint  of  our  operations.  Taking  a  step  further,  DIMO  is  now \nactively assessing the financial impacts associated with natural capital, with a special \nfocus on climate-related risks by aligning with IFRS S1 and S2 standards and TCFD \nrecommendations. We are confident that proactive climate risk monitoring will enhance \nour ability to anticipate risks and strengthen our long-term sustainability journey.\nClimate Risk and Double Materiality \nClimate risks stemming from our operations and value chain ecosystem have a direct \nand significant influence on DIMO’s business conduct, underscoring their urgency and \nimportance for long-term business continuity. As such, the double materiality of climate \nrisks plays a vital role in our capital management strategy. On the one hand, climate risks \naffect business operations and pose long-term threats to financial capital. On the other, \nour operational footprint impacts natural capital - contributing to resource depletion and \ninfluencing our share of the global carbon budget.\nIn alignment with international best practices, we have adopted IFRS S1/S2 and TCFD \nframeworks to assess how climate risks affect our business performance. Additionally, \nwe utilize the GRI and SASB standards to evaluate how our business operations impact \nthe environment, ensuring a balanced view of our sustainability performance across all \ncapitals.\nT\nC\nF\nD\n,\n \nI\nF\nR\nS\n \nS\n2\nG\nR\nI\n,\n \nS\nA\nS\nB\nImpacts \non Natural \nCapital\nPhysical & \nTransition \nRisks\nDIMO \nOperations\nC\nl\ni\nm\na\nt\ne\n \nC\nh\na\nn\ng\ne\nE\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ns\nO\np\ne\nr\na\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nl\n \n&\nF\ni\nn\na\nn\nc\ni\na\nl\n \nI\nm\np\na\nc\nt\ns\nG\nH\nG\n \nE\nm\ni\ns\ns\ni\no\nn\ns\n,\nR\ne\ns\no\nu\nr\nc\ne\n \nU\ns\ne"

These \ninitiatives  have  been  governed  through \nthe Group IT Steering Committee, which \ncontinues to ensure that IT strategies are \ntightly integrated with business priorities, \nand that risk, performance, and resource \nmanagement  are  well-structured  and \ntransparent.\nData  governance  has  also  emerged \nas  a  cornerstone  of  the  Group’s  IT \ngovernance  model,  reinforced  through \nthe implementation of the “One-Number” \nreporting  framework.  This  initiative  establishes  a  single  source  of  truth  across  the \nenterprise, enabling consistent, accurate, and real-time insights that inform strategic and \noperational decision-making. In tandem, the organization has strengthened its regulatory \nposture by aligning data privacy practices not only with the EU General Data Protection \nRegulation (GDPR) but also with Sri Lanka’s Personal Data Protection Act No. 9 of 2022, \nensuring lawful, ethical, and transparent use of personal and customer data.\nDIMO’s  IT  Governance  framework  now  extends  beyond  compliance  and  control  to \nbecome a strategic enabler of innovation, agility, and competitive advantage. It ensures \nthat technology investments are responsibly managed, risks are proactively mitigated, \nand digital capabilities are deployed in a manner that drives sustainable business growth \nand strengthens stakeholder trust.\nCybersecurity\nCybersecurity has been identified as a strategic priority at DIMO, reflecting the Group’s \ngrowing  reliance  on  digital  platforms,  increasing  exposure  to  cyber  threats,  and  the \nimperative to safeguard sensitive business and customer information. Our cybersecurity \nstrategy  is  firmly  anchored  in  a  governance-led,  risk-aware,  and  technology-driven \napproach, ensuring resilience, compliance, and trust across all Group operations.\nFigure 17: Cybersecurity Governance Framework\nCybersecurity Framework\nFunctionsCategories\nGovernance Policies & Procedures\nGroup Cyber Security Risk Profile\nProtect / Prevent\nDetect\nRespond\nRecover\nUnauthorised Access to Critical \nInformation Systems (ERP ETC.\nData Theft\nFinancial Theft\nBusiness Email Compromise\nDenial of Service / Service Theft\nData Integrity Loss\nRansomware\nBrand / Reputational Loss\nDIMO’s  Cybersecurity  Framework  is  integrated  within  the  broader  IT  Governance \nstructure,  aligning  with  industry  standards  and  international  best  practices.

By offering \nreliable and high-performance vehicles, \nmachinery, products along with genuine \nparts and skilled after-sales service, \nwe deliver tangible value for our \nstakeholders. Our reputation is built \non the reliability and prestige of the \nbrands we associate, the comprehensive \nsolutions we provide, the technological \nadvancements and strong support and \nour contribution to the national economy. \nWe empower progress and development \nin the country through long-standing \nrelationships with multiple stakeholders \nand by building sustainable partnerships \n- for business, for community and for \nconservation. At DIMO, we are committed \nto ethical and responsible operations \nthroughout our operations. This \ncommitment to doing business the right \nway reflects a deeper purpose beyond \njust profit generation. We consider \nit critical to train and develop our \nemployees to build a skilled workforce: \ninvesting in local talent aligns with our \npurpose of national capacity building. \nDIMO’s leadership plays a crucial role \nin driving DIMO’s Sustainability Agenda \n2030. Our sustainability initiatives are \ncomprehensive and deeply integrated into \nour business strategy. Driven by the CEO \nand the 4 Pillar Heads (page 120 and 128), \nthe Agenda is committed to creating long-\nterm value for all our stakeholders while \ncontributing towards a sustainable future. \nBelow is how DIMO creates change \nin our work culture to bring the best \nintegrated solutions within departments, \nwithin businesses – creating a resilient \ncommunity driven by visionary leadership. \nCREATING HARMONY – ONE STEP AT A TIME\nVisionary \nCommitment\nEmbedding \nSustainability into \nOrganisational \nCulture\nChampioning Sustainability at the top. Starting with the Board of Directors and the Group CEO, consistently \nmaking sustainability a core value, integrating ESG and making it a strategic priority in decision making and \nresource allocation. \nArticulating  a  clear-cut  vision  and  purpose through DIMO Sustainability Agenda 2030, with its three \npillars provides a strong foundation. Aligned with global frameworks like IFRS, UNSDGs and the company’s \npurpose of ‘fuelling dreams and aspirations’ of the communities we serve. \nIntegrating sustainability in strategic planning ensures that sustainability considerations are integrated \nin all aspects, from product development and supply chain management to market expansion and risk \nmanagement. DIMO already aims to generate 50% of its revenue from sustainable products and services \nby 2030 which demonstrates clear integration.\nThe leadership recognizes sustainability is not just a way to mitigate negative impacts, but is a strategic \napproach and opportunity to innovate, enhance customer experience, secure brand loyalty and foster long-\nterm competitiveness. \n‘DIMO Ability’ initiative, an internal campaign showcases employee engagement as well as leadership \nroles within a sustainable workplace. \nRegular  communication  on  sustainability  related  topics  with  employees,  highlighting  DIMO’s  goals, \ninitiatives  and  progress  through  various  media,  engagement  and  activities.  Conducting  trainings  and \nawareness to educate employees on sustainable practices relevant to their job role is key. DIMO Nature Club \nis a good example of engaging employees in conservation efforts and supporting community wellbeing. \nEmpowering  employees  and  encouraging  employee  participation in sustainability initiatives, creates a \nplatform for them to contribute ideas and drive change from the ground up. The volunteerism promoted \nby DIMO Nature Club exemplifies this and programs like ‘Powerfully You’ which empowers women in the \nworkplace. \nRecognizing and rewarding sustainable behaviour can bring significant changes. Mechanisms such as \ncelebrating DIMO Nature Club’s anniversary and recognizing members on their commitment to conducting \nschool programs and engaging in other conservation and community wellbeing efforts demonstrates \nleadership and contributes significantly to DIMO’s sustainability goals.\nVirtuous LeadershipAt DIMO"

DIMO’s  Sustainability  Agenda  has  7  KPIs  that  cut  across  business, \nemployees, community and the environment, visualizing the journey for 2030, setting a clear path. \nImplementing strategies to minimize waste, maximise resource efficiency and promote the reuse and \nrecycling of materials across DIMO’s value chain, promotes a circular economy within the group. \nThe management systems in place throughout our business promotes standardization in environment \nmanagement, occupational health and safety, certified quality assurance in our service while we ensure \nthat we are conscious of our carbon footprint. \nEncouraging and investing in research and development of sustainable products, services and operational \nprocesses inspires continuous improvement. Our focus on electric vehicles, our own formula customization \nin Agri Fertilizer and innovative idea generation for vehicle service promotes investing  in  sustainable  \ntechnologies and innovation. \nIntegrating  sustainability  criteria  into  our  supplier  selection  through  our  ‘Supplier  Code  of  Conduct’ \nencourages our partners to adopt environmentally and socially responsible practices. DIMO’s focus on \ntransparency and social accountability in its agricultural supply chains is a positive step for sustainable \nsupply chain management.  \nImplementing measures to reduce energy consumption – promoting renewable energy sources like DIMO’s \nenergy solar PV systems and optimizing water usage, specifically in our vehicle service – where we reuse \nour  wastewater  for  vehicle  undercarriage  washing.  These  actions  not  only  contribute  to energy  and  \nresource efficiency but also align with the Sustainability Agenda KPIs. \nDIMO’s collaboration with partners is what creates success stories. Partnering with other organisations; \nNGOs,  government  agencies,  research  institutes,  other  corporate  entities  to  advance  sustainability \ninitiatives and sharing best practices, brings out the best results. Our biodiversity and environment projects \nare a few examples of working with different stakeholders including the community. \nIt is not just collaboration externally; collaboration internally within departments is a key factor for a \nsuccessful sustainable implementation within the organisation. We collaborate with many departments \nat DIMO to bring the best expertise from Power Tools, Vehicle Service and Technical Education for the \ncommunity. \nThis enhances our sustainability efforts and access to innovative solutions. \nRegularly  reporting  on  DIMO’s  sustainability  performance,  progress  towards  targets  and  vision  to \nall  stakeholders;  investors,  customers,  employees  and  the  public  demonstrate transparency  in  our  \ncommunication and our commitment in our journey. \nDIMO’s customer experience involves educating customers on sustainability aspects and encouraging \nthem to make more sustainable choices through our excellent customer engagement. \nDIMO’s community KPI for 2030 is very ambitious. Our continuity in investing in community development \naligns  with  our  2030  KPI  and  strategy  in  creating  a  resilient  community.  Our  focus  is  specifically  on \neducation and health care. Even our biodiversity restoration projects, working on climate and conservation, \nhelps communities to thrive within a natural ecosystem while protecting it. \nVirtuous LeadershipAt DIMO"

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described \nin the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements \nsection of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with \nthe  Code  of  Ethics  for  professional  Accountants  issued  by  CA  Sri  Lanka  \n(Code of Ethics), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in \naccordance with the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence \nwe have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our \nopinion.\nKey Audit Matters\nKey  audit  matters  are  those  matters  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  \nwere of most significance in our audit of the company financial statements \nand the consolidated financial statements for the current period. These \nmatters  were  addressed  in  the  context  of  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  \nfinancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and \nwe do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. \nRevenue Recognition\nSee note 3.7 for Summary of significant Accounting, Judgments, Estimates and Assumptions and note 4.1 for accounting policy and \ninformation\nRisk DescriptionOur Response\nThe Group carry out its business operations in different sectors which result \nin high volume of revenue transactions in different revenue streams which \nrequires judgment in some of the revenue transactions in order to determine \nthe  timing  and  the  amount  of  revenue  recognition.  Further,  in  accordance  \nwith Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuS), there is a presumed fraud risk \nrelating to revenue recognition.\nRevenue recognition of certain items of the Group and the Company require \njudgement which will increase the risk of material misstatement of revenue, \ncontract liabilities and other related balances.\nWe consider this as a key audit matter because of the significant judgment \nassociated  with  the  appropriate  recognition  of  revenue  in  the  correct  \naccounting period.\nOur audit procedures included;\n yObtaining an understanding of and assessing the design, \nimplementation and operating effectiveness of management key \ninternal controls involved in the revenue recognition including the \nkey IT controls relating to revenue recognition\n yPerforming detailed analysis of revenue, testing the timing \nof its recognition and accuracy of the amounts recognized for \nsignificant revenue streams.\n yReviewing the adequacy, relevance and accuracy of the \naccounting policies and disclosures in the financial statements."

The  carrying  \namount  of  each  investment  in  subsidiaries  and  related  goodwill  have  been  tested  \nfor impairment as individual Cash Generating Units. The carrying amount of these \ninvestments and goodwill could be materially misstated if inappropriate judgments \nand estimates were used by the management in calculating the recoverable amount \nfor each cash generating unit (‘CGU’) as part of their impairment assessment.\nWe identified assessment of impairment of investment in subsidiaries and Goodwill \nas a key audit matter due to significant degree of management judgment involved in \nmaking this assessment and in forecasting the future cash flows of the companies \nwhich could have significant impact on the financial statements. Further, impact \nprevailing volatile macro-economic environment on the business operations resulted \nin increased estimates and judgements involved in the assessment of impairment of \ninvestment in subsidiaries and Goodwill.\nOur audit procedures included,\n yObtaining an understanding of management’s impairment \nassessment process\n yEvaluating the indications of possible impairment of \ninvestments in subsidiaries and Goodwill.\n yObtaining the forecasted cash flow projections of the \nsubsidiaries, equity accounted investees and assessing \nthe reasonableness of the forecasts and challenging the \nassumptions used in the valuation.\n yReviewing the effectiveness of management’s process \nin developing these forecasts by comparing the actual \nfinancial results against previous projections.\n yAssessing the adequacy of disclosures made in the \nfinancial statements with the relevant accounting \nstandards.\nOther Information \nManagement   is   responsible   for   the   other   information.   The   other   \ninformation comprises the information included in the annual report, but \ndoes not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.\nOur  opinion  on  the  financial  statements  does  not  cover  the  other \ninformation  and  we  do  not  express  any  form  of  assurance  conclusion  \nthereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility \nis to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other \ninformation is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our \nknowledge  obtained  in  the  audit  or  otherwise  appears  to  be  materially  \nmisstated.  If,  based  on  the  work  we  have  performed,  we  conclude  that  \nthere is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required \nto report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged \nwith Governance for the Financial Statements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of financial statements \nthat  give  a  true  and  fair  view  in  accordance  with  Sri  Lanka  Accounting  \nStandards,  and  for  such  internal  control  as  management  determines  is  \nnecessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free \nfrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn  preparing  the  financial  statements,  management  is  responsible  for \nassessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as \napplicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern \nbasis  of  accounting  unless  management  either  intends  to  liquidate  the  \nGroup or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\nThose  charged  with  governance  are  responsible  for  overseeing  the  \nCompany’s and the Group’s financial reporting process.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the \nFinancial Statements\nOur  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  \nfinancial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement, \nwhether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes \nour opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a \nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs will always \ndetect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  \nfrom  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  \naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SLAuSs, we exercise professional \njudgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

Management makes estimates \nand  judgements  based  on  current  knowledge,  historical  experience  and  \nvarious  other  assumptions  that  are  held  to  be  reasonable  under  the  \ncircumstances. However, actual results may differ from these judgements \nand  estimates.  Estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  \nan  ongoing  basis  and  revisions  to  accounting  estimates  are  recognised  \nprospectively.\nThe  key  assumptions  concerning  the  future  and  other  key  sources  of  \nestimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk \nof  causing  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amounts  of  assets  and  \nliabilities within the next financial year, are also described in the individual \nnotes  to  the  Financial  Statements.  The  Group  based  its  assumptions  \nand estimates on parameters available when the Consolidated Financial \nStatements  were  prepared.  Existing  circumstances  and  assumptions  \nabout future developments, however, may change due to market changes \nor  circumstances  arising  that  are  beyond  the  control  of  the  Group.  Such  \nchanges are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\nJudgements,  estimates  and  assumptions  made  by  management  which  \nhave  the  most  significant  effect  on  the  amounts  recognised  in  these \nConsolidated Financial Statements are described in the following Notes.\nTable 78: Accounting Policies\nAccounting PolicyNote\nRevenue Recognition4.1\nImpairment of non financial assets 3.9.3\nIncome tax and deferred tax assets and liabilities4.31 / 4.26\nUseful life time of property, plant and equipment4.9\nRevaluation of property, plant and equipment 4.9\nProvision for impairment of trade receivables 4.16\nAsset held for sale 4.20\nEmployee benefits4.25\nWarranty provisions4.28.2\nProvision on inventories4.15\nRight-of-use assets and lease liabilities4.10 / 4.24.3\nCommitments and Contingencies4.34\nConsolidation3.9.1\nEquity accounted investees3.9.1\nAcquisition of subsidiaries3.9.1\nImpairment test on goodwill3.9.1\n3.8 Material  Accounting Policies\nSummary  of  material  accounting  policies  are  presented  along  with  the  \nrelevant individual notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThose  accounting  policies  presented  with  each  note,  have  been  applied  \nconsistently by the Group to the all periods presented in this report.\nSet out below is an index of the Material  accounting policies, the details \nof which are available on the pages indicated.\nTable 79: Material Accounting Policies\nNote Accounting PolicyPage No.\n4.1Revenue230\n4.2Operating Segments233\n4.3Other Operating Income238\n4.4Net Finance Cost238\n4.5Profit Before Tax239\n4.6Taxation240\n4.7Earnings Per Share-Basic and Diluted242\n4.8Dividends243\n4.9Property, Plant and Equipment243\n4.10Right-of-Use Assets249\n4.11Intangible Assets and Goodwill 250\n4.12Investments in Subsidiaries and Equity-Accounted \nInvestees\n253\n4.13Financial Assets and Liabilities257\n4.14Equity Securities265\n4.15Inventories266\n4.16Trade and Other Receivables267\n4.17Other Current Assets270\n4.18Other financial assets270\n4.19Cash and Cash Equivalents270\n4.20Assets Held for Sale271\n4.21Stated Capital271\n4.22Revenue Reserve272\n4.23Other Components of Equity272\n4.24Interest Bearing Borrowings273\n4.25Employee Benefits277\n4.26Deferred Tax279\n4.27Contract Liabilities283\n4.28Provisions284\n4.29Trade and Other Payables284\n4.30Other Current Liabilities285\n4.31Income Tax Assets and Liabilities286\n4.32Amounts due (to)/from Subsidiaries and Equity-\nAccounted Investees\n286\n4.33Related Party Disclosures289"

A business \ncombination is accounted for when the acquired set of activities and assets \nmeets the definition of a business and control is transferred to the Group.\nThe consideration transferred in the acquisition in a business combination \nis generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable assets acquired \nand liabilities assumed. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in \nStatement of Profit or Loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed \nas incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity instruments. \nThe  consideration  transferred  does  not  include  amounts  related  to  the  \nsettlement  of  pre-existing  relationships.  Such  amounts  are  generally  \nrecognised in Profit or Loss. \nAcquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.  \nIf  the  business  combination  is  achieved  in  stages,  any  previously  held  \nequity  interest  is  remeasured  at  its  acquisition  date  fair  value  and  any  \nresulting gain or loss is recognised in Profit or Loss.\nAny  contingent  consideration  is  measured  at  fair  value  at  the  date  of  \nacquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the \ndefinition of a financial instrument within the scope of SLFRS 9- Financial \nInstruments is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured subsequently, \nand settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent \nconsideration  is  remeasured  at  fair  value  at  each  reporting  date  and  \nsubsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are \nrecognised in Profit or Loss.\nb)  Subsidiaries\nSubsidiaries  are  investees  that  are  controlled  by  the  Group  .  The  Group    \n‘Controls’ an investee if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns \nfrom  its  involvement  with  the  investee  and  has  the  ability  to  affect  \nthose  returns  through  its  power  over  the  investee.  At  each  reporting  \ndate  the  Group    reassesses  whether  it  controls  an  investee  if  facts  and  \ncircumstances  indicate  that  there  are  changes  to  one  or  more  of  the  \nelements of control mentioned above. The Financial Statements of all the \nsubsidiaries  are  included  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  from  \nthe date on which control commences until the date when control ceases.\nA  change  in  the  ownership  interest  of  a  subsidiary,  without  a  loss  of  \ncontrol, is accounted for as an equity transaction.\nIf  the  Group  loses  control  over  a  subsidiary,  it  derecognises  the  related  \nassets  (including  goodwill),  liabilities,non-controlling  interest  and  other  \ncomponents  of  equity  while  any  resultant  gain  or  loss  is  recognised  in  \nprofit or loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value.\nConsolidation of subsidiaries with different accounting periods\nThe  Financial  Statements  of  the  parent  Company  and  subsidiaries  are  \nprepared to a common financial year ending 31st March, except for DIMO \nLanka  Company  Limited  and  United  DIMO  Company  Limited  whose \nfinancial  year  ends  on  30th  September.  These  subsidiaries  prepared \nfinancial information as at 31st March 2025 for consolidation purpose. The \nreason for using different reporting period by the above two subsidiaries \nlocated in Myanmar is due to the requirement imposed by the Government \nof Myanmar.  The Financial Statements of the parent and subsidiaries are \nprepared using uniform accounting policies. \nThere are no significant restrictions (other than obtaining approval from \nthe  Central  Bank  of  the  relevant  country)  on  the  ability  of  subsidiaries  \nto  transfer  funds  to  the  Company  (the  \"Parent\")  in  the  form  of  cash \ndividend or repayment of loans and advances except for the subsidiaries \nincorporated in Myanmar. The current regulations in Myanmar are unclear \nabout remittance of cash dividends or repayment of loans and advances \nbeing remitted out of the country. \nc)  Non-Controlling Interests\nNon-controlling  interests  are  measured  initially  at  their  proportionate \nshare of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets at the date \nof acquisition.\nChanges in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss \nof control are accounted for as equity transactions, that is, as transactions \nwith the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair \nvalue  of  any  consideration  paid  and  the  relevant  share  acquired  of  the  \ncarrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in Equity.\nA list of material non -controlling interest is set out in Note 4.12.3 to the \nFinancial Statements.\nSECTION 3 - BASIS OF ACCOUNTING"

Cash-generating units to \nwhich goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or \nmore frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. \nIf  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  cash-generating  unit  is  less  than  the  \ncarrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce \nthe carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the \nother  assets  of  the  unit  pro-rata  on  the  basis  of  the  carrying  amount  of  \neach asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not \nreversed in a subsequent period.\nOn disposal of a cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill \nis included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.\ne)  Equity-Accounted Investees\nInterests   in   the   Joint   venture   are   accounted   for   using   the   equity   \nmethod  except  when  the  investment  is  classified  as  held  for  \nsale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with SLFRS 5. They are \ninitially  recognised  at  cost,  which  includes  transaction  costs,  in  terms  of  \nSri Lanka  Accounting Standards – LKAS 28 on “Investments in Associates \nand  Joint  Ventures”.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  the  Consolidated  \nFinancial Statements include the Group’s share of the profit or loss and \nother comprehensive income of equity-accounted investees, until the date \non which significant influence or joint control ceases.\nA Joint venture is a joint  arrangement in which the Group has joint control, \nwhereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather \nthan  rights  to  its  assets  and  obligations  for  its  liabilities.  Joint  control  is  \nthe  contractually  agreed  sharing  of  control  of  an  arrangement,  which  \nexists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous \nconsent of the parties sharing control.\nThe Financial Statements of the joint venture are prepared for the same \nreporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to \nbring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it \nis necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its joint \nventure.  At  each  reporting  date,  the  Group  determines  whether  there  is  \nobjective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is impaired. If \nthere is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as \nthe difference between the recoverable amount of the  joint venture and \nits carrying value, and then recognises the loss within ‘Share of profit or \nloss of equity accounted investees’ in the Statement of Profit or Loss.\nUpon  loss  of  significant  influence  over  the    joint  control  ,  the  Group \nmeasures  and  recognises  any  retained  investment  at  its  fair  value.  Any  \ndifference  between  the  carrying  amount  of  the    joint  venture  upon  loss  \nof significant influence or joint control and the fair value of the retained \ninvestment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in the Statement of \nProfit or Loss\nExcept DIMO Coastline (Private) Limited Financial Statements of the joint \nventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.\nEquity accounted investees  are disclosed in Note 4.12.4 to the Financial \nStatements.\nf)  Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation\nIntra-group   balances   and   transactions,   and   any   unrealised   income   \nand  expenses  arising  from  intra-group  transactions  are  eliminated  in  \npreparing  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Unrealised  losses \nare also eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the \nextent that there is no evidence of impairment. A change in the ownership \ninterest  of  a  subsidiary,  without  a  loss  of  control,  is  accounted  for  as  an  \nequity transaction.\n3.9.2  Foreign Currency\nTransactions and Balances\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency \nat the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary \nassets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into \nthe  functional  currency  using  closing  rate,  which  is    the  exchange  rate  \nprevailing at the reporting date .\nNon-monetary  items  that  are  measured  based  on  historical  cost  in  a \nforeign  currency  are  translated  at  the  exchange  rate  at  the  date  of  the  \ntransaction.\nForeign currency differences are recognised in the Statement of Profit or \nLoss. However, foreign currency differences arising from  equity securities \ndesignated  as  FVOCI  (except  foreign  currency  differences  relating  to  \nimpairment ) are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).\nShare capital denominated in a currency other than the functional currency \nis initially converted using the exchange rate as at date of issue but is not \nre-translated."

If any such indication exists, \nthen the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill and Intangible \nassets with an indefinite useful life are tested annually for impairment. \nRefer note 4.11.1 for goodwill impairment.\nThe ‘recoverable amount’ of an asset is the greater of its value in use and \nits  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell.  ‘Value  in  use’  is  based  on  the  estimated  \nfuture  cash  flows,  discounted  to  their  present  value  using  a  pre-tax \ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value \nof money and the risks specific to the asset. The fair value less costs to \nsell  calculation  is  based  on  available  data  from  an  active  market,  in  an  \narm’s  length  transaction,  of  similar  assets  or  observable  market  prices  \nless incremental costs for disposing of the asset. For impairment testing, \nassets  that  cannot  be  tested  individually  are  grouped  together  into  the  \nsmallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use \nthat is largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets.\nAn  impairment  loss  is  recognised  if  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  \nexceeds   its   recoverable   amount.   Impairment   losses   are   recognised   \nin  Profit  or  Loss  except  for  properties  previously  revalued  with  the \nrevaluation  taken  to  Other  Comprehensive  Income,  For  such  properties,  \nthe  impairment  is  recognised  in  Other  Comprehensive  Income  up  to  \nthe  amount  of  any  previous  revaluation.  Impairment  losses  recognised  \nin  prior  periods  are  assessed  at  each  reporting  date  for  any  indication  \nthat  the  loss  has  decreased  or  no  longer  exists.  An  impairment  loss  is  \nreversed  if  there  has  been  a  change  in  the  estimates  used  to  determine  \nthe  recoverable  amount.  An  impairment  loss  in  respect  of  goodwill  is  \nnot  reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the  \nextent that the asset’s carrying amount that would have been determined \n(net of depreciation or amortisation) had no impairment loss recognised .\n \nin prior years.\nThe parent, subsidiaries and joint venture have access to adequate funding \nto continue their business operations. Based on the assessments made to \nthe recoverable amounts of non-financial assets, including investments in \nsubsidiaries, there were no indications that require an adjustment in the \nfinancial statements other than disclosure made in 4.12.2.\n3.9.3.2. Right to Use of Assets\nThe Group does not foresee any impairment of the right to use assets due \nto the prevailing and anticipate effects of the current economic conditions \nand does not anticipate discontinuation of any asset before the previously \nexpected  date,  for  which  the  Group  possesses  the  right  to  use.  Lease  \nliabilities are not reassessed as there are no known moratoriums received \nfor the lease payments so far.\n3.9.4  Statement of Cash Flows\nThe  Statement  of  Cash  Flows  has  been  prepared  by  using  the  ‘Indirect  \nMethod’ of preparing cash flows in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting \nStandard-LKAS 7 on ‘Statement of Cash Flows’.

Determining the timing of the transfer of control \nof  goods  or  services,  at  a  point  in  time  or  over  time,  requires  judgments  \ntaking into consideration the nature of goods or services that Group offers.\nSome contracts include multiple deliverables. Where the contracts include \nmultiple  performance  obligations,  the  transaction  price  will  be  allocated  \nto each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. \nWhere these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on \nexpected cost plus margin.\nThe  Group  disaggregate  its  revenue  into  following  categories  based  on  \nthe nature, amount , timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows \narising from contracts with customers.\nSale of Goods\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when \ncontrol  of  the  goods  is  transferred  to  the  customer,  usually  on  delivery  \nof  the  goods.    Sales  are  measured  at  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  \nreceived  or  receivable  excluding  amounts  collected  on  behalf  of  third  \nparties  (e.g.  Sales  taxes)  and  variable  consideration  (  e.g.  discounts  and  \nrebates).  The  Group  estimates  an  amount  of  variable  consideration  by  \nusing the expected value method which is the sum of probability weighted \namounts in a range of possible considerations.\nRendering of Services\nRevenue  from  rendering  of  services  is  recognised  when  the  Group  \nsatisfies all performance obligations by transferring a promised service \nto a customer.\nConstruction Related Contracts\nRevenue   from   construction   related   contracts   is   recognised   upon   \nsatisfaction of a performance obligation agreed in the contract. At contract \ninception,  the  Group  determines  whether  it  satisfies  the  performance \nobligation over time or at a point in time. The revenue recognition occurs \nat a point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer. \nFor each performance obligation satisfied over time, the Group recognises \nthe  revenue  over  time  by  measuring  the  progress  towards  complete  \nsatisfaction of that performance obligation.\nThe progress is assessed based on surveys of work performed. When the \noutcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract \nrevenue  is  recognised  only  to  the  extent  of  contract  costs  incurred  that  \nare likely to be recoverable.  An expected loss on a contract is recognised \nimmediately in profit or loss.\nService Support Income\nService  support  income  which  is  included  in  revenue  represents  income  \nreceived from foreign principals on indent sales. Such income is recognised \non  an  accrual  basis  at  the  time  of    satisfying  performance  obligation  \nrelating to the service support provided by the Group.\nSignificant financing component \nThe Group assesses each contract with customers to determine whether \nthere  is  a  significant  financing  component,  in  accordance  with  the \nguidance  in  SLFRS  15.  The  interest  income  or  expense  arising  from  the  \nsignificant financing component is recognised separately from revenue in \nthe statement of profit or loss using the effective interest method over \nthe period of the financing.The Group does not adjust for a significant \nfinancing component if the time difference between payment and delivery \nis one year or less, or where the effect of the time value of money is not \nmaterial.\n4.1.1  Disaggregation of Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn the following tables, revenue from contract with customers is disaggregated by nature of the product and timing of revenue recognition.\n4.1.1.1.

Income tax \nexpense is recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss, except to the \nextent it relates to a business combinations or to items recognised directly \nin equity or other comprehensive income in which case it is recognised in \nequity or in other comprehensive income.\nCurrent tax\nCurrent  tax  laibilities  /assets  consist  of  best  estimate  of  the  amounts  \nexpected  to  be  paid  to  /recovered  from  the  taxation  authorities.  Current  \ntax  liabilities  /assets  in  respect  of  the  current  as  well  as  prior  years  are  \nmeassured using the tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted \nby  the  end  of  the  reporting  period.    Accordingly,  provision  for  taxation  \nis  based  on  the  profit  for  the  year  adjusted  for  taxation  purposes  in \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  No  24  of \n2017 and subsequent amendments thereto  and relevant statutes of tax \njurisdictions in countries where the group operates, at the rates specified \nin Note 4.6.1 to the Financial Statements.\nThe Group has applied IFRIC Interpretation 23 “Uncertainty over Income \nTax Treatment” in the determination of taxable profit, tax bases, unused \ntax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is an uncertainty \nover the income tax treatment.\nAdvance Income Tax (AIT) on Dividends\nCurrent AIT rate on dividend is 15% and it is a final tax. Dividend paid by a \ncompany is exempted in the hands of shareholders to the extent that such \ndividend payment is attributable to, or derived from dividend received by \nthe company or another resident company.\nDeferred Tax\nA detailed disclosure of accounting policies and estimate of deferred tax \nare available in Note 4.26.\nAccounting Estimate\nThe Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax, based on an estimate \nof  taxable  income.  Given  the  wide  range  of  business  relationships  and  \nthe long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, \ndifferences  arising  between  the  actual  results  and  the  assumptions  \nmade,  or  future  changes  to  such  assumptions,  could  necessitate  future  \nadjustments to tax expense already recorded. Where the final tax outcome \nof such matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, \nsuch differences will impact the income and deferred tax amounts in the \nperiod in which the determination is made.\nSales Taxes\nRevenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales \ntax except:\n yWhere the sales tax incurred on the purchase of an asset or \nservice is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which \ncase the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition \nof the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and\n yWhere receivables and payables are stated with the amount of \nsales tax included.\n yThe net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the \ntaxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables \nin the statement of financial position.\n yVAT liability arises on the turnover is 18% and SSCL chargeable \non the liable turnover is 2.5%."

Cost  includes  expenditure  \nthat is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and subsequent \ncosts (as explained under subsequent cost ) . The cost of self-constructed \nassets include the cost of materials, direct labour, any other costs directly \nattributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended \nuse,  the  costs  of  dismantling  and  removing  the  items  and  restoring  the  \nsite  on  which  they  are  located  and  borrowing  costs  that  are  directly  \nattributable to the asset under construction.\nIf  significant  parts  of  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  have \ndifferent useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major \ncomponents) of property, plant and equipment.\nPurchased software which is integral to the functionality of the related \nequipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.\nCost Model\nAll  property,  plant  and  equipment  except  freehold  land,  are  recorded  at  \ncost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, \nif any.\nWhen an asset’s carrying value is higher than it’s recoverable amount, \nthe carrying value is written down to its recoverable amount (Please refer \nNote  3.9.3 - Impairment of non-financial assets).\nRevaluation Model\nThe Group applies the revaluation model for the entire class of freehold \nland  for  measurement  after  initial  recognition.  The  Group  policy  is  to  \nrevalue  all  freehold  land  by  an  independent  professional  valuer  every  \nthree  years  or  when  there  is  a  substantial  difference  between  the  fair  \nvalue and the carrying amount.\nOn  revaluation  of  an  asset,  any  increase  in  the  carrying  amount  is  \nrecognised in revaluation reserve in equity through Other Comprehensive \nIncome or used to reverse a previous loss on revaluation of the same asset, \nwhich was charged to Profit or Loss. In this circumstance, the increase is \nrecognised  as  income  only  to  the  extent  of  the  previous  write  down  in  \nvalue. Any decrease in the carrying amount is recognised as an expense \nin Profit or Loss or charged to revaluation reserve in equity through Other \nComprehensive Income, only to the extent of any credit balance existing \nin the revaluation reserve in respect of that asset. Any balance remaining \nin the revaluation reserve in respect of an asset, is transferred directly to \nretained earnings upon disposal of the asset.\nThe  freehold  lands  were  valued  by  reference  to  transactions  involving  \nproperties of a similar nature."

    "text": "244Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC  |  Annual Report 2024/25\nSubsequent Costs\nSubsequent  expenditure  is  capitalised  only  when  it  is  probable  that  the  \nfuture economic benefits of the expenditure will flow to the Group and \nits  cost  can  be  measured  reliably.  The  costs  of  day  to  day  servicing  of  \nproperty, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred.\nDerecognition\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal \nor when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or \nloss arising on derecognition of the asset is recognised in  the Statement \nof Profit or Loss in the year the asset is derecognised.\nBorrowing costs\nBorrowing   costs   that   are   directly   attributable   to   the   acquisition,   \nconstruction  or  production  of  a  qualifying  asset  are  capitalised  as  part  \nof  the  cost  of  the  qualifying  asset.  A  qualifying  asset  is  an  asset  which  \ntakes  a  substantial  period  of  time  to  get  ready  for  its  intended  use  or  \nsale. Capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when substantially all the \nactivities  necessary  to  prepare  the  qualifying  asset  for  its  intended  use  \nare completed. Other borrowing costs are recognised in the Statement of \nProfit or Loss in the period in which they are incurred.\nCapital work-in-progress\nCapital work-in-progress is stated in the Statement of Financial Position at \ncost, including borrowing costs, less any accumulated impairment losses. \nCapital work-in-progress would be transferred to the relevant asset when \nit is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating \nin the manner intended by management (i.e. available for use).\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is calculated to write-off the cost of items of property, plant \nand equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-line \nmethod over their estimated useful lives and is recognised the Statement \nof in Profit or Loss. Freehold land is not depreciated. \nDepreciation  of  an  asset  begins  from  the  date  it  is  available  for  use  or  \nin  respect  of  self  constructed  assets  from  the  date  that  the  asset  is  \ncompleted  and  ready  for  use.  Depreciation  ceases  at  the  earlier  of  the  \ndate that the asset is classified as held for sale or the date that the asset \nis derecognised.\nThe estimated useful lives of PPE are as follows:\nTable 84: Useful Lives of Property Plant and Equipment\nClass of AssetYears\nBuildings and Premises36 - 40\nBuildings on leasehold land and \nimprovements\nOver the remaining lease \nperiod\nPlant and machinery 04-20\nTools and implements03-04\nMotor vehicles03-04\nFurniture and fittings04-13\nElectrical fixtures and office equipment04-10\nComputer hardware and accessories02-04\nResidual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are reviewed at \neach financial year end and adjusted if appropriate.\nSECTION 4 - SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING \nPOLICIES AND NOTES"

The Group applies \njudgements  in  evaluating  the  level  of  certainty  whether  the  option  of  \nrenewing the lease exits or otherwise.  That is, it considers all relevant factors \nthat  create  an  economic  benefits  for  it  to  exercise  either  the  renewal  or \ntermination options. The group has leased land and buildings with an option \nto renew after the original lease period. Lease terms are modified on an \nindividual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. \nBasis of Measurement\nThe Group recognises right-of-use assets at the date of commencement of \nthe  lease,  which  is  the  present  value  of  lease  payments  to  be  made  over  \nthe  lease term, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate \ncannot be readily determined, the group uses its incremental borrowing rate. \nRight-of-Use assets are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation \nand  impairment  losses  and  adjusted  for  any  re-measurement  of  lease  \nliabilities. The cost of the right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease \nliabilities  recognised,  initial  direct  cost  incurred,  and  lease  payments  made  \nat or before  the commencement date less any lease incentives received.\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term \nand  useful  life  of  the  right-of  use  asset.  If  a  lease  transfers  ownership  \nof the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that \nthe  group  expects  to  exercise  a  purchase  option,  the  related  right-of-\nuse asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The \ndepreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.\nShort-term Leases and Leases of Low-Value Assets\nThe  Group  has  elected  not  to  recognise  right-of  -use  assets  and  lease  \nliabilities  for  leases  of  low-value  assets  and  short-term  leases.  The  \nGroup recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an \nexpense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nCarrying value of Right-of-Use Assets\nGroupCompany\n2025202420252024\nLand and BuildingsRs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000\nCost\nAt the beginning of the year 1,227,761  1,192,148  903,636  878,839 \nAdditions during the year 398,765  66,601  327,318  37,995 \nDerecognition  (312,570) (11,981) (279,975) (11,981)\nRemesurements  (51,310)  -     -     -   \nEffect of movements in exchange rates (15,247) (19,007)  -    (1,217)\nAt the end of the year 1,247,399  1,227,761  950,979  903,636 \nAccumulated Amortization \nAt the beginning of the year 668,785  513,625  521,970  414,472 \nAmortization for the year (Note 4.5) 150,248  155,680  97,286  107,498 \nDerecognition  (305,533)  -    (272,938)  -   \nEffect of movements in exchange rates (2,806) (520)  -     -   \nAt the end of the year 510,694  668,785  346,318  521,970 \nCarrying amount at the end of the year 736,705  558,976  604,661  381,666 \nRight-of-use assets are presented in financial position as follows;\nClassified as non-current assets 736,705  558,976  604,661  381,666 \n 736,705  558,976  604,661  381,666 \nExpenses relating to short term leases and leases amounting to Rs.91.2 million (2023/24- Rs. 52.7  million) has recognized in Profit or Loss."

    "text": "250Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC  |  Annual Report 2024/25\n4.11 Intangible Assets and goodwill\nAccounting Policy\nBasis of recognition\nAn  intangible  asset  is  recognised  if  it  is  probable  that  future  economic  \nbenefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and the \ncost  of  the  asset  can  be  measured  reliably  in  accordance  with  the    Sri  \nLanka Accounting Standard – LKAS 38 on “Intangible Assets”.\nBasis of Measurement\nIntangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition \nat cost. The costs of intangible assets acquired in a business combination \nare  recognised  at  their  fair  value  at  the  date  of  acquisition.  Following  \ninitial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated \namortisation   and   accumulated   impairment   losses,   if   any.   Internally   \ngenerated intangibles, excluding capitalised  development costs, are not \ncapitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in the Statement of \nProfit or Loss in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.\nSubsequent Expenditure\nSubsequent  expenditure  is  capitalised  only  when  it  increases  the  future  \neconomic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All \nother expenditure is recognised in Profit or Loss as an when incurred.\nUseful Economic Lives, Amortisation and Impairment\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortised using the straight-line \nmethod  to  write  down  the  cost  over  its  estimated  useful  economic  lives  \nand  are  generally  recognised  in  Profit  or  Loss.    The  estimated  useful \nlife  and  amortisation  method  are  reviewed  at  the  end  of  each  reporting  \nperiod,  with  the  effect  of  any  changes  in  estimate  being  accounted  for  \non  a  prospective  basis.  Goodwill  and  intangible  assets  with  indefinite \nuseful lives are not amortised. These assets are assessed for impairment \nannually  and  whenever  there  is  an  indication  that  the  intangible  asset  \nmay be impaired.\nThe period over which intangible assets are amortised is as follows;\nTable 86: Useful Lives of Intangible Assets\nClass of AssetYears\nComputer software 04-10\nAgency and product distribution rights Indefinite\nThe above rate is consistent with the rate used in the previous years. The \namortisation  method,  useful  lives  and  residual  values  are  reviewed  at  \neach reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.\nAgency and product distribution rights\nDuring the year, DIMO Lifeline (Private) Limited, a subsidiary of the Group \nacquired agency and product distribution rights for a consideration of Rs. \n400 million.\nThe asset is considered to have an indefinite useful life, as it is not limited \nby contractual term and is expected to generate economic benefits over an \nindefinite period. Accordingly, it is not amortized but is subject to annual \nimpairment testing under LKAS 36.\nNo impairment indicators were identified as at the reporting date.\nGoodwill Arisen through Business Combination\nThe Group recognised an intangible asset by way of goodwill in respect of \nthe registered and established product portfolio, customer lists, technical \nexpertise and distribution network acquired from acquisition of the stake \nin each subsidiary which mentions in Note 4.11.1 below. The management \nis  of  the  opinion  that  the  brand  names  of  the  subsidiaries  acquired  \ntogether  with  its  duly  registered  product  portfolio  will  bring  synergies  \nto  the  current  product  offering  of  the  Company  in  each  sector  which  it  \noperates and bring future economic benefits to the group.\nImpairment of  Goodwill\nThe  group  tests  goodwill  annually  for  impairment,  or  more  frequently  if  \nthere are indications that goodwill might be impaired.\nDerecognition\nIntangible  assets  are  derecognised  upon  disposal  or  when  no  future  \neconomic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on \nderecognition of the asset, is recognised in Profit or Loss in the year the \nasset is derecognised.\nSECTION 4 - SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING \nPOLICIES AND NOTES"

If any such indication exists, then the \nrecoverable  amount  of  the  investment  is  estimated  and  the  impairment  \nloss is recognised to the extent of its net assets loss.\nChanges in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss \nof control are accounted for as equity transactions- that is, as transactions \nwith the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair \nvalue  of  any  consideration  paid  and  the  relevant  share  acquired  of  the  \ncarrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.\nPlease refer the note 2.2 to the financial statements for Nature and the \nBusiness operations of the subsidiary companies\nAccounting Estimate - Provision for Impairment\nThe  carrying  amount  of  investments  made  in  subsidiaries  are  reviewed  \nat  each  reporting  date  to  determine  whether  there  is  any  indication  of  \nimpairment.  If  any  such  indication  exists,  then  the  asset’s  recoverable  \namount   is   estimated.   However   goodwill   arising   from   the   business   \ncombination is tested annually for impairment as given in the Note 4.12.1.\nBased  on  impairment  assessment  carried  out  as  at  31st  March  2025,  \nit  was  concluded  that  the  net  realisable  value  of  all  the  investments  \nincluded  under  unquoted  investments  exceeds  its  carrying  value  except  \nfor investment made in Tropical Health Food (Private) Limited. Therefore, \nbased on an assessment made for impairment, the provision given in the \nNote 4.12.1.2 was considered to be adequate as at the reporting date.\n4.12.1.1  Carrying Value of Investments in Subsidiaries made by the Company\nAs at 31st March20252024\nHoldingNo.of sharesCostHoldingNo.of sharesCost\n(%)Rs.‘000(%)Rs.‘000\nUnquoted Investment - Ordinary Shares\nDIMO (Private) Limited 99.99 150,024,999  1,500,250 99.99 24,999  250 \nDIMO Industries (Private) Limited 99.99 2,300,499  23,050 99.99 2,300,499  23,050 \nDIMO Travels (Private) Limited99.99 9,980  998 99.80 9,980  998 \nDIMO Lifeline (Private) Limited*75 7,500,000  300,000 100 1  0.04 \nDIMO Lanka Company Limited 99.99 77,922  128,593 99.90 77,922  128,593 \nPlantChem (Private) Limited 70 19,483,949  346,258 70 19,483,949  346,258 \nPlant Seeds (Private) Limited 70 9,027,509  357,772 70 9,027,509  357,772 \nMoveflex (Private) Limited100 120,000  12,000 100 120,000  12,000 \nDIMO Bangladesh (Private) Limited99.99 618,049  213,864 99.99 618,049  213,864 \nTropical Health Food (Private) Limited94.45 12,670,420  450,080 94.45 12,670,420  450,080 \nVirgin Oil International (Private) Limited51 7,007,991  40,000 51 7,007,991  40,000 \nMansel (Ceylon) (Private) Limited75 2,380,848  179,990 75 2,380,848  179,992 \nAssociated Laboratories (Private) Limited75 2,075,145  45,010 75 2,075,145  45,010 \nDIMO Solar Beliatta (Private) Limited1001 0.1 1001 0.1 \nDIMO Solar Galle (Private) Limited1001 0.1 1001 0.1 \nDIMO Solar Galle Two (Private) Limited1001 0.1 1001 0.1 \nDIMO Solar Galle Three (Private) Limited1001 0.1 1001 0.1 \nDIMO Solar Galle Four (Private) Limited1001 0.1 1001 0.1 \nDIMO Solar Anuradhapura (Private) Limited1001 0.1 1001 0.1 \nDIMO Australia (Private) Limited1001 18.5 1001 18.5 \nDIMO Academy of Higher Education (Private) Limited1001 0.01 1001 0.01 \n 3,597,886  1,797,886 \nImpairment provision (Note 4.12.1.2) (164,883) (141,575)\n 3,433,003  1,656,311 \n* On 28th June 2024, DIMO Lifeline (Private) Limited, a subsidiary company of Group has issued Rs.100 million shares to Non Controlling Interest.

At the end \nof each reporting period all classifications are re-evaluated to the extent \nthat such classification is required and permitted.\nReceivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they \nare originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially \nrecognised when the Group  becomes a party to the contractual provisions \nof the instrument.\nA  financial  asset  (unless  it  is  a  trade  receivable  without  a  significant \nfinancing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value \nplus transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition. \nA trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially \nmeasured at the transaction price determined under SLFRS 15.\nClassification and Measurement\nThe  classification  of  financial  assets  at  initial  recognition  depends  on \nthe Group’s  business model for managing the financial assets and the \ncontractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.\nBusiness Model Assessment\nThe Group  makes an assessment of the objective of the business model \nin which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level, because it reflects the \nway the business is managed and information is provided to management. \nThe information considered includes:\n yhow the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported \nto the Group’s Management;\n ythe frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in \nprior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about \nfuture sales activity.\nAssessment whether Contractual Cash Flows are Solely \nPayments of Principal and Interest\nFor  the  purposes  of  this  assessment,  ‘principal’  is  defined  as  the  fair \nvalue of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as \nconsideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated \nwith the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time \nand for other basic lending risks and costs as well as a profit margin. In \nassessing  whether  the  contractual  cash  flows  are  solely  payments  of \nprincipal  and  interest,  the  Group  considers  the  contractual  terms  of  the  \ninstrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains \na contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual \ncash flows such that it would not meet this condition."

This  election  is  \nmade on an investment-by-investment basis.\nFinancial Asset at Amortised Cost\nA financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the \nfollowing conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n yit is held within a business model whose objective is to hold \nassets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n yits contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows \nthat are solely payments of principal and interest on the \nprincipal amount outstanding.\nThe Group’s financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost \nare  limited  to  its  trade  and  other  receivables,  amounts  due  from  related  \nparties and cash & cash equivalents.\nSubsequent Measurement and Gains and Losses\nSubsequent measurement of Group’s financial assets are as follows;\nFinancial assets \nat amortised cost\nThese assets are subsequently measured at amortised \ncost using the effective interest method. The amortised \ncost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, \nforeign  exchange  gains  and  losses  and  impairment  \nare recognised in Profit or Loss. Any gain or loss on \nderecognition is recognised in Profit or Loss\nEquity \ninvestments at \nFVOCI\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. \nDividends are recognised as  other income in profit or \nloss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery \nof  part  of  the  cost  of  the  investment.  Other  net  gains  \nand  losses  are  recognised  in    Other  Comprehensive  \nIncome and are never reclassified to Profit or Loss.\nDerecognition of Financial Assets\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset (or where applicable a part of \nthereof) when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset \nexpire,  or  it  transfers  the  rights  to  receive  the  contractual  cash  flows \nin  a  transaction  in  which  substantially  all  of  the  risks  and  rewards  of  \nownership of the financial asset are transferred, or it neither transfers \nnor  retains  substantially  all  of  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  and  \nit does not retain control over the transferred asset. Any interest in such \nderecognised financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is \nrecognised as a separate asset or liability. \nOn derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying \namount  of  the  asset  (or  the  carrying  amount  allocated  to  the  portion  \nof  the  asset  derecognised)  and  the  sum  of  the  consideration  received  \n(including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any \ncumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in Other Comprehensive \nIncome is recognised in Profit or Loss.\nFinancial liabilities\nInitial Recognition and Measurement\nFinancial  liabilities  are  classified  as  measured  at  amortised  cost  or \nFVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held \n- for - trading at the initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are \nmeasured at fair value and any resulting gains and losses, including any \ninterest expense, are recognised in Profit or Loss. \nAt the end of each reporting period all classifications are re-evaluated to \nthe extent that such classification is permitted and required.\nAll the financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any \ndirectly  attributable  transaction  costs.  Other  financial  liabilities  mainly \nconsist of trade and other payables and bank borrowings.\nSubsequent Measurement\nOther financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost. \nInterest  expense  and  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  are  recognised  \nin profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in \nProfit or Loss.\nThe  amortised  cost  of  a  financial  liability  is  the  amount  at  which  the \nfinancial  liability  is  measured  at  initial  recognition,  minus  principal \nrepayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective \ninterest method minus any reduction for impairment.\nDetails  of  financial  liabilities  recognised  in  the  Statement  of  Financial \nPosition are given in Notes 4.24 and 4.29 on pages 273 and 284.\nDerecognition\nThe  Group  derecognises  a  financial  liability  when  its  contractual \nobligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.\nOffsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount \npresented in the Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, \nthe Group currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts \nand intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and \nsettle the liability simultaneously.\nSECTION 4 - SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING \nPOLICIES AND NOTES"

The Group's risk \nmanagement process identifies and analyses the risks it faces, establishes \nappropriate  risk  limits  and  controls,  and  monitors  and  manages  events  \nthat could have a substantial impact on capital and earnings.\nThe  overall  objectives  and  policies  for  the  Group’s  financial  risk \nmanagement are as per the internal treasury practices. It will cover foreign \nexchange policy, investment policy, financing policy and policies on credit \nrisk and risk limits. \nThe  Group’s  risk  management  policies  are  established  to  identify  and  \nanalyse  the  risks  faced  by  the  Group,  to  set  appropriate  risk  limits  and  \ncontrols and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management \npolicies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market \nconditions and the Group’s activities. \nThe  Group  audit  committee  is  assisted  in  its  oversight  role  by  internal  \naudit.  Internal  audit  undertakes  both  regular  and  ad  hoc  reviews  of  risk  \nmanagement controls and procedures, the results of which are reported \nto the audit committee. Further details of management of risk is available \nfrom pages 105 to 118.\n(a) Market Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial \ninstrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, such as \nforeign  exchange  rates,  interest  rates  and  equity  prices,  which  will  \naffect the Group’s profit or loss or the value of its holdings of financial \ninstruments.  The  objective  of  market  risk  management  is  to  manage  \nand  control  market  risk  exposures  within  acceptable  parameters,  while  \noptimising the return.\nSECTION 4 - SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING \nPOLICIES AND NOTES"

Financial  instruments  affected  by  market  risk  include  loans  and  \nborrowings, deposits, debt and equity investments.\nThe sensitivity analysis in the following sections relate to the position as \nat 31st March 2025 and 2024.\n(i)  Foreign Currency Risk\nCurrency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial \ninstrument will fluctuate because of changes in  foreign exchange rates. \nThe Group has exposure to foreign currency risk from the cash flows of \noverseas  operations  and  foreign  currency  transactions  and  balances  \nwhich are affected by foreign exchange movements.\nBeing imports oriented, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates \nhave a significant impact on the cost of materials and the stocks purchased \nby  the  Group  Companies.  The  Group’s  Financial  Statements  which  are  \npresented in LKR, are affected by foreign exchange fluctuations through \nboth translation risk and transaction risk.  \nAs at 31st March 2025, rupee appreciated by  2% against the US dollar \ncompared to its closing rate on 31st March 2024. Apart from the currency \nappreciation  there  were  some  improvements  in  foreign  currency  market  \ndue to the improved market liquidity. Most of the import restrictions were \nlifted  and  margin  requirements  for  certain  imports  were  withdrawn.  \nHowever the volatility of the rupee can be expected once the foreign debt \nrepayment commences and import restrictions are fully lifted. There is no \nformal guidance by Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on exchange rate.\nGroup  Treasury  closely  monitors  the  behaviour  of  exchange  rates  and  \nthe  market  conditions  to  provide  continuous  market  updates  to  Group  \nManagement   Committee   (GMC)   and   Cluster   Heads   to   make   timely   \ndecisions. Group Treasury also proactively adopted prudent measures to \nmitigate the adverse impacts arising from such constraints and currency \nfluctuations by matching foreign currency liabilities with foreign currency \nassets  wherever  possible  and  by  leveraging  on  the  strong  relationships  \nthe Group maintains with the Financial Institutions. With the conscious \nstrategy of the Group to preserve foreign currency cash balances and the \ndecision to invoice certain customers in foreign currency, Group managed \nto  create  natural  hedges  to  the  extent  possible  mitigating  the  foreign  \ncurrency risk. \nThe overall objective of currency risk management is to reduce the short-\nterm negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash \nflow, thereby increasing the predictability of the financial results.\nThe  following  table  demonstrates Group exposure to currency risk as at \nthe reporting date.\nSensitivity Analysis - Based on Exchange Rate Fluctuation \nThe main foreign currencies that the Group transacts in are the US dollar and the Euro.

However , the Group recognised an expense of Rs. 0.96 million for such inventories during the year (2023/24 – Rs. 64.9 million).\n4.16  Trade and Other Receivables\nAccounting Policy\nTrade  receivables  are  amounts  due  from  customers  for  goods  sold  or  \nservices performed in the ordinary course of business. Other financial \nnature receivables are recognised as other receivables. \nTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at  Transaction Price  \nand subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest \nmethod, less provision for impairment. \nAccounting Estimate - Provision for Impairment\nGroup  makes  impairment  for  receivables  based  on  the  simplified \napproach  to  provide  for  Expected  Credit  Losses  (ECLs)  as  per  SLFRS  9,  \nwhich permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade \nreceivables. \nMeasurement of ECLs\nECLs  are  a  probability-weighted  estimate  of  credit  losses.  Credit  losses  \nare measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference \nbetween the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract \nand  the  cash  flows  that  the  Company  expects  to  receive).  ECLs  are \ndiscounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\nThe   allowance   is   provided   by   considering   evidence   of   impairment   \nfor  receivables  at  both  an  individual  asset  and  at  a  collective  level.  \nAll  individually  significant  receivables  are  individually  assessed  for \nimpairment   by   considering   objective   evidence   i.e.   experiencing   a   \nsignificant financial difficulty or default in payments by a customer. All \nindividually insignificant debtors and based on management judgment, \nsimilar risk characteristic debtors that are not specifically impaired are \nthen  collectively  assessed  for  any  impairment  that  has  been  incurred  \nbut not yet identified by grouping them together based on similar risk \ncharacteristics.\nIn assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical information \non the probability of default, the timing of recoveries, and the amount of \nloss  incurred,  and  makes  an  adjustment  if  current  and  forward  looking  \neconomic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely to \nbe greater or lesser than suggested historical trends."

A contract is, or contains a lease, if the contract conveys \nthe right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in \nexchange  for  a  consideration.  To  assess  whether  a  contract  conveys  the  \nright to control the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition \nof a lease in SLFRS 16.\nThe  lease  liability  is  initially  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the  lease  \npayments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using \nthe  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease  or,  if  that  rate  cannot  be  readily  \ndetermined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group \nuses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\nThe  lease  liability  is  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  \ninterest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease \npayments arising from a change in an index or rate.\n4.24.3.1  Movement of Lease Liabilities\nGroupCompany\nAs at 31st March2025202420252024\nRs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000\nAt the beginning of the year 676,840  773,680  466,143  533,412 \nAdditions during the year 397,498  74,340  327,317  37,995 \nAccretion of interest (Note 4.4) 72,849  77,145  48,902  52,620 \nLease modification (51,310)  -     -     -   \nDerecognition of lease agreements during the year (7,815) (16,524) (7,815) (12,912)\nPayments to lease creditors (221,952) (212,162) (143,988) (144,972)\nEffect of movements in exchange rates (13,965) (19,639)  -    - \nAt the end of the year 852,145  676,840  690,559  466,143 \nLease liabilities presented in Statement of Financial Position as follows;\nClassified as non current liabilities  755,605  517,968  616,886  373,096 \nClassified as current liabilities  96,540  158,872  73,673  93,047 \n 852,145  676,840  690,559  466,143 \nMaturity Analysis of lease payments\n - Less than 1 year 96,540  158,872  73,673  93,047 \n - 1 to 5 year 492,000  370,489  442,091  250,486 \n - More than 5 years 263,605  147,479  174,795  122,610 \n 852,145  676,840  690,559  466,143 \nInterest recognised in net finance cost (Note 4.4) 72,849 77,14548,90252,620\nAmortization of right-of-use assets recognised in administrative expenses (Note 4.5) 150,248 155,68097,286107,498\nThe Group and Company had total cash outflows for leases of Rs.221.9 million and Rs. 143.9 million in 2024/25.

A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the \nGroup has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as \na result of the past service provided by the employee and the obligation \ncan be estimated reliably.\nLiabilities  recognised  in  respect  of  short-term  employee  benefits  are \nmeasured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid \nin exchange for the related service.\nDefined contribution plan\nA  defined  contribution  plan  is  a  post-employment  benefit  plan  under \nwhich  an  entity  pays  fixed  determinable  contributions  into  a  separate \nentity  and  will  have  no  legal  or  constructive  obligation  to  pay  further  \namounts.\nEmployees are eligible to Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) contributions \nand  Employees’  Trust  Fund  (ETF)  contributions  as  per  the  respective  \nstatutes. These obligations come within the scope of a defined contribution \nplan as per LKAS -19 on ‘Employee Benefits’. Obligations for contributions \nto defined contribution plans are recognised in Profit or Loss as the related \nservice is provided.\nDefined benefit obligation\nIn accordance with the Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983, a liability arises for a \ndefined benefit obligation to employees.\nSuch defined benefit obligation is a post-employment benefit obligation \nfalling  within  the  scope  of  Sri  Lanka  Accounting  Standard  LKAS  -19  on  \n‘Employee Benefits’.\nThe liability recognised in the Statement of Financial Position is the present \nvalue of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date. The calculation \nis performed annually by  Mr. Poopalanathan , AIA, of Messer. Actuarial & \nmanagement Consultants (Private) limited , firm of professional  qualified \nactuary using the Projected Unit Credit method (PUC). Remeasurement of \nthe defined benefit liability, which comprises actuarial gains and losses \nare  recognised  immediately  in  Other  Comprehensive  Income.  The  Group  \nrecognises  the  increase  in  defined  benefit  liability  attributable  to  the \nservices provided by employees during the year (current service cost ) in \nProfit or Loss together with the interest expenses. A long term treasury \nbond  rate  10%  p.a.  (2023  -  12%)  was  used  to  discount  future  liabilities  \ntaking in to consideration the remaining working life of employees.\nAccounting Estimate\nThe  actuarial  valuation  involves  making  assumptions  about  discount  \nrates,  future  salary  increases  and  mortality  rates.  The  complexity  of  the  \nvaluation, the underlying assumptions and its long term nature, the defined \nbenefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions.

Contract  liabilities  \ninclude long-term advances received to deliver goods and services, short-\nterm advances received to render certain services as well as transaction \nprice allocated to unprovided free services relating to vehicle sales.\nUpon transferring the promised goods or services related to the liability, \namount will be recognised as revenue in Statement of Profit or Loss and \nOther Comprehensive income.\nAdvances Received from Customers\nThe  Group  receives  advance  payments  from  customers  under  both  \nconstruction-related   contracts   and   vehicle   sales   agreements.   These   \nadvances  are  recognised  as  contract  liabilities  at  the  time  of  receipt,  \nrepresenting  the  Company's  obligation  to  transfer  goods  or  services  to  \ncustomers in the future.\n\"Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognised based on the satisfaction of \nthe related performance obligations as follows:\nConstruction  Contracts:  Revenue  is  recognised  over  time  or  at  a  point  in  \ntime, depending on the nature of the contract. When recognised over \ntime,  it  is  measured  based  on  surveys  of  work  performed.  Alternatively,  \nrevenue is recognised at the point when control of the constructed asset \nis transferred to the customer. The contract liability relating to advances is \nderecognised upon completion of the work or certification of milestones, \nreflecting satisfaction of the performance obligation.\nVehicle  Sales:  Revenue  from  vehicle  sales  is  recognised  at  a  point  in  \ntime,  generally  upon  delivery,  when  control  of  the  vehicle  passes  to  the  \ncustomer.\nAmounts related to unsatisfied performance obligations are presented \nas contract liabilities and are recognised as revenue when the respective \nobligations are fulfilled.\nUnprovided Free Services Relating to Vehicle Sales\nAccounting Policy\nThe Company sells vehicles bundled with free services to the customers \nwith limitations on mileage or usage period. The unprovided free services \nare  recognised  as  contract  liability  at  the  time  of  selling  the  vehicles  at  \nits  relative  fair  value  and  recognised  as  revenue  when  the  performance  \nobligation relating to liability is satisfied. i.e. upon provision of the service \nor expiration of entitled period or/and criteria, whichever occurs first.\nAccounting Estimate - Relative Fair Value of Free Services\nThe  amount  charged  by  the  Company  in  respect  of  each  service  is  \nrecognised  at  the  relative  fair  value  of  free  services.  These  amounts  are  \nestimated  using  the  combination  of  historical  experience  in  service  and  \nprice changes.\nThe  Company  allocates  a  portion  of  the  consideration  received  to  the  \nunprovided  free  services  relating  to  vehicle  sales  based  on  the  relative  \nstand-alone  selling  prices.  The  amount  allocated  to  Unprovided  Free \nServices Relating to Vehicle Sales is deferred, and is recognised as revenue \nwhen  Services  provide  or  the  likelihood  of  the  customer  redeeming  \nthe  free  services  becomes  remote.  The  deferred  revenue  is  included  in  \ncontract liabilities.\n4.27.1 Carrying Value of Contract Liabilities\nGroupCompany\nAs at 31st March2025202420252024\nRs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000\nBalance beginning of the year 1,723,536  1,590,348  786,667  478,706 \nAdvance received 11,868,744  4,646,364  9,193,431  3,142,191 \nRecognised as revenue during the year (10,569,656) (4,466,836) (7,902,517) (2,836,732)\nInterest income during the year (48,673) (95,062)  -    (21,810)\nInterest expense during the year 4,748  48,722  4,748  24,312 \nAt the end of the year 2,978,699  1,723,536  2,082,329  786,667 \nClassified as current liabilities  2,332,543  854,855  1,810,083  691,577 \nClassified as non current liabilities  646,156  868,681  272,246  95,090 \n 2,978,699  1,723,536  2,082,329  786,667"

Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be \nreimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement \nis  recognised  as  a  separate  asset  but  only  when  the  reimbursement  is  \nvirtually  certain.  The  expense  relating  to  any  provision  is  presented  in  \nProfit or Loss net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of \nmoney is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate \nthat reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where \ndiscounting  is  used,  the  increase  in  the  provision  due  to  the  passage  of  \ntime is recognised as a finance cost.\nProvisions  are  calculated  based  on  the  historical  experience  and  the \nspecific terms in the individual cases. The Group arrives at an estimate on \nthe basis of an evaluation of the most likely outcome.\nAll known provisions have been accounted for in preparing these Financial \nStatements.\n4.28.2 Warranty Provisions \nThe  provision  for  warranty  relates  mainly  to  vehicles  sold  for  which  the  \ncompany gives warranty commencing from the date of sale. The warranty \nreceived by manufacturer is effective from date of shipment. This causes \na time window during which the company is exposed to warranty liability. \nA provision for warranty is recognised to cover such exposure to a liability. \nThe  provision  is  based  on  the  historical  warranty  data  and  a  weighting  \nof  possible  outcomes  against  their  associated  probabilities.  The  said  \nwarranty provision will be reversed upon expiration of the warranty period.  \nAlso, the Group provides warranty for retail items sold and construction \nprojects based on the respective sales agreements. \n4.28.3 Provision for Litigation and Claims\nThe Management considers likelihood of any claim succeeding, in making provisions. The time of concluding legal claims is uncertain, as is the amount of \npossible outflow of economic benefits. The timing and cost ultimately depend on the due process in the respective legal jurisdictions.\nGroupCompany\nAs at 31st March2025202420252024\nRs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000\nProvision for litigation and claims 11,000  11,000  11,000  11,000 \nProvisions for warranty (Note 4.28.3.1) 139,844  138,841  118,265  123,332 \n 150,844  149,841  129,265  134,332 \n4.28.3.1 Carrying value of warranty provision\nGroupCompany\nAs at 31st March2025202420252024\nRs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000\nBalance Beginning of the year 138,841  78,076  123,332  62,931 \nProvision made during the year 303,355  97,559  286,580  89,449 \nAmount reversed during the year (302,352) (36,794) (291,647) (29,048)\nCarrying value at the end of the year 139,844  138,841  118,265  123,332 \n4.29  Trade and Other Payables\nAccounting Policy\nTrade  payables  are  obligations  to  pay  for  goods  or  services  that  have  been  acquired  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  Trade  and  other  payables  are  \nclassified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented \nas non-current liabilities.\nTrade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\nSECTION 4 - SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING \nPOLICIES AND NOTES"
