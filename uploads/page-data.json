My  optimism  \nis well founded considering the opportunities \nenvisaged and our adaptability  to bag them. \nThe segments such as vehicle sales and those \nconnected to the construction industry, which \ncomprise  a  significant  portion  of  Group’s \nrevenue,  were  at  the  bottom  of  their  current  \nbusiness cycle. The indications are that a new \ncycle is about to be launched.    \nThe  vehicle  import  restrictions  continued  for  \nthe fourth year, with the construction industry \nin hibernation, while the appetite for spending \non  capital  equipment  and  projects  by  both  \nthe  private  and  public  sectors  was  subdued.  \nThe financial year demanded that we be at \nthe  peak  of  our  agility  to  overcome  these  \nsetbacks.

As  a  group,  we  are  \nready  to  embrace  the  opportunities  around  \nthe corner, with confidence. \nOpportunity to Re-visit Vehicle \nImport Regulations\nThe  vehicle  sales  segment  is  expected  to  \nbecome  active  once  again  paving  the  way  \nfor   the   commencement   of   another   cycle.   \nFrom  a  national  point  of  view,  it  is  very  \nimportant   that   the   country   regulates   the   \nimport  of  vehicles  well;  while  revenue  must  \nDespite such adversity, the members of the Group Management \nCommittee rose to the task and delivered their best. The driving force \nof DIMO is undoubtedly my tribe. The extra mile they drove to make us \na better company is very much appreciated. \nbe  protected,  there  should  be  strict  controls  \non    allowing  old  vehicles  into  the  market,  \nwhich  will  become  a  burden  on  the  country  \nin  terms  of  subsequent  demand  for  spare  \npart  imports  and  emissions.  This  is  a    great  \nopportunity to bring healthy new regulations \nfor vehicle imports . \nThe  vehicle  leasing  industry  too  needs  to  \nconsider    reducing  the  initial  contribution  \nrequired by the lessor, provided it is consistent \nwith the country’s monetary regulations.\nFocus on Scalability\nMany  investments  made  in    the  recent  past  \nin    Agriculture,    Healthcare,    Infrastructure    \nEngineering      and      now      in      renewable      \nenergy   demand   scalability,   thus   requiring   \ntechnological  interventions.  During  the  year  \nunder review,  our  key focus was deployment \nof  the  Enterprise  Platform  and  technologies  \nthat  work  on  this  platform  .  This  placed  a  \nsignificant demand on our  resources, and \nwe  had  no  hesitation  in  allocating  them,  \nconsidering  the  opportunities  that    come  \nwith  it.  My  tribe  members  too  rose  to  the  \noccasion,  understanding  its  importance  to  \nDIMO. During the implementation of SAP, we \nalso re-structured the way we were organised \nin  order  to  deliver  better  value,  to  create  \nthe      capacity   required   for   new   business   \npropositions,  facilitate  data  driven  decision  \nmaking and improve the cost: benefit ratio \nwhen scaling up businesses.\nThe Transforming Journey\nSince   its   establishment,   DIMO   has   been   \nsynonymous  with  vehicle  sales,    given  our  \nassociation  with  leading  automobile  brands  \nin the world. That may have to change. Thay \nmay have to change with the prevailing high \ntariff   structures   and   the   import   ban,   the   \nrevenue  from  the  vehicle  sales  segment  is  \nunlikely to reach previous levels.

However,  we    eagerly  await  \nthis opportunity.\nThe  agriculture  segments  have,  meanwhile,  \nmade steady progress to become the largest \ncontributor  to  the  Group  Turnover.  Together  \nwith    other    investments,    the    non-auto    \nrevenues  are  growing  rapidly  in  proportion  \nto     the     auto-related     businesses.     Such     \ntransformation  is  by  design  in  order  to  have  \nofferings with different risk profiles and to \nspread our risk over a larger portfolio.\nCommitment to Sustainability\nWe   committed   ourselves   to   sustainability,   \ncontributing to the Sustainable Development \nGoals   (SDGs)   set   by   the   United   Nations.   \nWe   have   experienced   many   opportunities   \nthat  come  with  sustainability;  similarly,  we  \nalso   know   the   risks   associated   with   not   \nbeing    sustainable.    We    have    established    \nour   own   Sustainability   Agenda   2030   to   \ndrive  our  efforts  in  support  of  the  SDGs  and  \nto   manage   risks   and   opportunities.   The   \nagenda  includes  yearly  milestones  to  guide  \nour  efforts.  DIMO  has  adopted  many  best  \npractices in sustainability reporting to ensure \ntransparency in our efforts. We have also gone \nthe extra mile to obtain independent auditors’ \nassurance on our non-financial data, which \nincludes sustainability related disclosures.\nReducing Risks Arising from \nDependencies \nDIMO  has  traditionally  been  associated  with  \nbest-in-class brands and has for years, built \nrelationships  of  value  with  our  principals,    \nthe custodians of the brands. Over the years, \nthese     relationships     have     tremendously     \nhelped  DIMO  to  become  what  we  are  today.  \nAt  the  same  time,  we  must  acknowledge  \nthat  most  of  DIMO’s  businesses  are  heavily  \ndependent   on   external   factors   such   as   \ngovernment     policy,     tariffs,     regulations,     \ninterest  rates  and  even  the  weather.  Such  \ndependencies are perhaps common to many \nbusinesses.  With  a  view  to  managing  the  \nrisks  posed  by  such  dependencies,  we  have  \nnow set our sights on further diversification \nwhereby  the  new  dependencies  will  differ  \nfrom   the   existing   ones.   Our   entry   into   \nagriculture  is  a  case  in  point.  We  will  pursue  \nour interests in new business domains and in \ndifferent value chains such as manufacturing \nand  exports.  Renewable  Energy,  Education  \nand Food Industry are  the  current domains \nof interest and attention. \nReturns from Investments\nWe  classify  the  new  ventures    undertaken  \nin   the      recent   past   into   stages   such   as   \nformation,   scale   up,   mature   and   market   \ndominant,  it  becomes  apparent  that  only  \na  few  have  reached  the  maturity  or  ‘market  \ndominant’    status.    The    PlantChem    and    \nPlantseeds   businesses,   acquired   six   years   \nago, have now become market dominant. The \nrest will stress the resources and profitability \nuntil  they  reach  at  least  maturity  stage.  We  \nare  now  diligently    focussed  on  advancing  \nour  new  ventures  in  healthcare,  exports  and  \nin agriculture to maturity stage. \nShareholder Returns\nAs  I  explained,  DIMO  has  been  able  to  lay  \na   strong   foundation   for   growth   through   \ndiversification and  in readiness for scalability. \nThis  demanded a fair amount of investment, \nespecially  during  a  period  of  adversity.  This  \nhas curtailed the returns in terms of dividends \nduring the recent past. I thank the shareholders \nfor their understanding and remain confident \nthat these investments will deliver more value \nin the medium and long term.\nThe Board of Directors\nI   have   been   fortunate   to   have   the   good   \ncounsel    of    a    Board    of    Directors    with        \nexpertise   in   multiple   disciplines   .   I   thank   \nthem    for    their    continued    commitment    \ntowards governing the company and driving \nit  in  the  right  direction,  notwithstanding  the  \nexternal shocks that we have had to face as a \ncompany in the recent past.\nThe  listing  rules  issued  last  year  requires  \na  change  in  the  composition  of  the  Board  \nbefore later this year, and the Board together \nwith   the   Nomination   Committee   are   on   \ncourse to meet this requirement on time.\nOne  key  change  that  occurred  during  the  \nfinancial  year  is  the  appointment  of  Mr. \nGahanath   Pandithage   to   the   position   of   \nGroup  Managing  Director  with  effect  from  \n01st  September  2023,  a  position  that  was  \npreviously held by me. He is now designated \nGroup   Managing   Director/Chief   Executive   \nOfficer.  Mr.  Gahanath  Pandithage  has  38 \nyears of experience with DIMO and has held \nseveral key positions in different disciplines.\nLooking Ahead\nI  would  like  to  identify  three  areas  that  will  \nreceive  special  attention  in  the  year  ahead.  \nFirstly, we will scale up the business activities  \nin   acquisitions   and   investments   made   to   \ndate  so  that  they  will  reach  maturity  stage,  \nif  not  market  dominant  stage,  during  this    \nyear.  Secondly,  we  aim  to  achieve  a  high    \nturnover  growth  rate  .  Thirdly,  we  plan  to  \nfurther  expand  the  technological  capability  \nof the back-end by deploying add-ons to the \nEnterprise Resource Management platform.  \nAppreciation\nIt  was  not  by  any  means  an  easy  task  to  \nnavigate  through  times  with  this  magnitude  \nof   external   shocks,   and   more   so   with   a   \nmulti-year  ban  on  vehicle  imports  directly  \nimpacting  a  segment  where  we  have  made  \nsignificant  investments  over  the  years. \nDespite  such  adversity,  the  members  of  the  \nGroup  Management  Committee  rose  to  the  \ntask  and  delivered  their  best.  The  driving  \nforce  of  DIMO  is  undoubtedly  my  tribe.  The  \nextra  mile  they  drove  to  make  us  a  better  \ncompany is very much appreciated. \nWe have always enjoyed the acceptance and \nrespect  of  many  foreign  principals,  whose  \nbest in class brands have immensely helped \nDIMO  to  build  our  own  brand  equity.  Indeed,  \nthey  have  been  a  major  source  of  strength  \nduring DIMO’s journey. \nFinally, I thank all stakeholders of DIMO – our \ncustomers,   bankers   and   many   more   who   \nhave  contributed  over  the  years  to  build  \nwhat DIMO is today.\nRanjith Pandithage\nChairman\n20th June 2024\nColombo\nAn immersive experience with \nAugmented Reality (AR) – Scan \nthe QR code & hold the smart \nphone over the printed report\nhttps://www.dimolanka.\ncom/2023-2024-dimo-\nannual-report/url.php?id=6"

    "text": "12 Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC\nGroup Managing Director /  \nCEO's Message\nI  am  delighted  to  address  our  shareholders  \nand  stakeholders  as  we  conclude  another  \nfinancial  year.  This  year  presented  both \nchallenges     and     opportunities.     Despite     \nvarious     headwinds     impacting     business     \nsentiment and profitability, we successfully \nadvanced   our   core   strategy   across   our   \nportfolio,    geographical    presence,    organic    \ngrowth, and being the ‘partner of choice’.\nA Remarkable Year of Transformation\nThe  year  2023/24  marked  a  significant \nmilestone    in    DIMO's    history    with    the    \nadoption  of  the  Tier-1  Enterprise  Resource  \nPlanning  system,  SAP.  As  a  diversified \nconglomerate  operating  in  seven  business  \nsegments, planning and executing this digital \ntransformation   blueprint   was   a   complex   \ntask   that   spanned   nearly   three   years.   In   \nDecember  2023,  we  successfully  launched  \nthe new technology into operation. We have \nnow  integrated  45  modules,  including  eight  \ntechnical modules, enhancing our operational \ncapabilities. This achievement would not have \nbeen  possible  without  the  dedicated  efforts  \nof  the  committees  that  worked  on  \"Project  \nGenesis\".  The  second  phase  of  the  project  \nis  scheduled  to  commence  in  2024/25,  with  \nthe  aim  of  introducing  advanced  predictive  \ncapabilities.\nNavigating the Storm\nThe fiscal year 2023/24 presented significant \nfinancial  challenges  for  DIMO.  The  vehicle \nimport ban, now in its fourth consecutive year, \nseverely  impacted  our  revenue  stream  as  \nvehicles have historically been our cash-cow. \nThe  downturn  in  the  construction  industry  \nhad a substantial negative effect on our civil \nconstruction  and  building  services  sectors,  \nas  well  as  on  our  construction  machinery  \nWe vigorously pursued our three strategic pillars - Diversification, \nDifferentiation, and Collaboration - to address current challenges \nmore effectively. As a result, we identified seven strategic priorities \nduring 2023/24, which will serve as the central focus of our  \nmedium-to long-term planning.\nbusiness.   The   retail   sector   also   struggled   \ndue  to  decreased  purchasing  power  among  \nconsumers.\nThere  were  positive  contributions  from  our  \nAgriculture    and    Automotive    Engineering    \nSolutions  segments,  which  provided  some  \nrespite from the difficulties in other segments \nand thereby mitigating the overall impact of \nthe year’s challenges.\nThe  profit  before  tax  reduced  to  Rs.  183 \nmillion  (Rs.  737  million  -  2022/23)  partially  \nhaving   taken   the   burden   in   the   interest   \ncost    relating    to    borrowings    for    recent    \ninvestments,  some  of  which  did  not  provide  \nreturns  as  anticipated.  The  retail  segment  \ntoo performed below expectations whilst we \nawait a gradual opening of vehicle imports.\nStrategic Reflections\nWe  vigorously  pursued  our  three  strategic  \npillars - Diversification, Differentiation, and \nCollaboration - to address current challenges \nmore effectively. As a result, we identified \nseven   strategic   priorities   during   2023/24,   \nwhich  will  serve  as  the  central  focus  of  our  \nmedium-to long-term planning. \nThroughout the year, we remained committed \nto our three strategic ambitions: building a \nresilient  product  portfolio,  achieving  organic  \ngrowth, and becoming the partner of choice. \nThis  focus  ensured  that  we  maintained  our  \ncompetitive  edge  even  during  challenging  \ntimes.  \nUnlocking Global Potential\nAs  part  of  our  expansion  strategy  and  to  \nmitigate    the    impact    of    local    economic    \nfluctuations,  we  have  pursued  business \ngrowth   beyond   Sri   Lanka.

To  \nillustrate,  when  the  corporate  strategy  guides  \nthe businesses to embrace diversification, the \nbusinesses strive for product diversification as \nwell as geographic diversification, both locally and \nglobally. Under the differentiation pillar, product \ndifferentiation via value proposition and process \ndifferentiation via customer experience are two \nroots  taken.  The  continued  collaboration  pillar  \nembraces   collaboration   with   all   stakeholders.   \nThis is evident in agribusiness integrations, new \nbusiness  partnership  alliances  across  the  group  \nas well as employee collaboration.\nOur  key  strategic  enablers  –  Group  HR  strategy,  \nGroup    Technology    strategy,    Group    Marketing    \nstrategy   and   Group   Sustainability   strategy   -   \nSustainability  Agenda  2030  are  well  in  place  to  \nsupport  the  three  primary  pillars  of  strategy  at  \ngroup level as well as segment level. \nThe  DIMO  Group  has  identified  its  strategic \npriorities  in  the  short-to  medium  term  which  \nare elaborated on page 23 - 24.\nGroup Governance \nRefer page 80 - 109 to read more on \nCorporate Governance\nPolicies_Structures_Processes\nThis comprises of robust boundaries established \nto    ensure    transparency,    consistency    and    \naccountability  across  the  group.  As  a  diverse  \nconglomerate  that  continuously  broadens  its  \nbusiness  domains  locally  and  globally,  there  \nis  increased  necessity  for  a  strong  governance  \nstructure that includes well defined policies, firm \nstructures  and  efficient  processes.  The  Code \nof  Conduct  for  suppliers,  Group  Management  \nComittee   (GMC),   Cyber   security   governance,   \nsustainability  governance,  policies  for  health  &  \nsafety,  policies  for  quality  &  environment  are  \na  few  examples  of  how  we  are  structured  to  \ngovern the business.\nDIMO at a Glance  \n|\n  Management CommentaryEnterprise Governance  \n|\n  Sustainability  \n|\n  Financial Statements  \n|\n  Annexures\nGRI: 2-6, 303-1, 303-2, 303-3, 303-4, 305-4, 305-5, 306-1, 306-5, 403-1, 403-3"

Similarly, our \ndedicated  business  development  team  pays  \ngreat attention to the opportunities that can \nbe capitalised on by the group. The two agri-\nrelated  businesses  “Cococarb  &  Cocofresh”  \nwhich  were  acquired  during  the  year,  are  a  \nresult   of   opportunity   management.

    "text": "28 Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC\nOperating Context \nOpening Remarks for Business Reports\nThe Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal aspects that would impact \nDIMO strategy and value creation are discussed below. This provides the context for the performance \nof the year as well as the strategies and outlook discussed throughout the report. \nPoliticalEconomic\nSri Lanka’s political stability vastly improved \nduring the year, and it appeared that the \ngovernment was in a position to execute \nits will. The announcement confirming that \nelections will be held during the year 2024 \nreduces  the  chances  of  political  unrest \nalthough  the  economic  advancements \nmade post-crisis may slow down. On the \nother hand, the establishment of a stable \ngovernment post-election augurs well for \nthe economic reforms necessary in the short \nterm.  \nImpact to DIMO\nDIMO’s    strategic    plan    envisages    further    \ndiversification and expansion in Sri Lanka. \nTherefore, political stability and the resulting \neconomic benefits are imperative to pursue \nthese  plans  with  confidence.  Political \ninstability  could  make  decisions  harder  and  \nrisks higher. From an operational point of view \nDIMO  would  like  to  see  a  stable  government  \ncarrying  out  economic  reforms  to  stabilise  \nmarkets and remove import barriers.\nFuture outlook\nThe   presidential   election,   which   is   likely   \nto  be  held  during  the  year  2024,  is  a  key  \nfactor  in  solidifying    investor  sentiment.  In  \nthe  event  the  people  of  Sri  Lanka  elect  a  \nPresident and Parliament (at the subsequent \nGeneral   Election)   that   establish   a   stable   \ngovernment,  the  business  community  may  \nbenefit from the government's ability to carry \nout economic reforms, maintain consistency \nin  monetary  and  fiscal  policy,  and  instill \nfinancial discipline in public sector. Needless \nto  say,  an  unstable  government  would  not  \nonly stifle economic growth but would also \nresult in market volatility, which will become \na  barrier  for  the  private  sector  to  drive  their  \nplans in Sri Lanka.\n2023 was a transitional year for Sri Lanka \nas it continued to recover from its worst \neconomic  crisis  since  independence. \nCompared  to  the  last  financial  year \n2022/23, the current economy is showing \ntentative  signs  of  stabilization,  with \nstable  inflation,  significant  revenue-\nbased  fiscal  adjustments,  and  reserves \nbuild-up.  \nImpact to DIMO\nFiscal\nIn  terms  of  GDP,  there  is  a  reduction  in  \nthe   rate   of   contraction   in   the   second   \nhalf of the financial year 2023/24. It has \nexpanded  4.5%  in  the  fourth  quarter  over  \nthe  same  quarter  of  the  previous  year.  \nThis  is  a  prospective  sign  of  recovery  for  \nour construction connected businesses.\nThe  revisions  in  VAT  rate  and  removal  of  \nexemptions   effective   01   January   2024   \nimpacted the demand and exerted pricing \npressures.   Increased   income   tax   rates   \ncontinued  to  hurt  the  take  home  pay  of  \nemployees.  \nMonetary\nThe  Group’s  interest  expenses  benefit \nfrom  the  decreasing  Average  Weighted  \nPrime Lending Rate (AWPLR). The reduced \nborrowing  costs  were  an  enabling  factor  \nfor  investments  in  new  business  and  for  \nacquisitions.\nDuring   the   year   2023   the   Sri   Lanka   \nRupee  appreciated  against  the  US  dollar  \nby  11.20%.  (Source  –  Central  Bank  of  Sri  \nLanka).  With  the  rupee  appreciation,  cost  \nof  imports  came  down,  which  became    a  \nconsiderable  benefit  for  prices  against \nthe  background  of  an  increase  in  direct  \ntaxes. The appreciation also had a positive \nimpact  on  domestic  consumer  spending  \nand   even   the   cost   of   capital   goods   \nimported,  which  is  a  substantial  part  of  \nDIMO’s offering.\nHeadline inflation, as measured by the Y-o-Y \nchange in the Colombo Price Index was 0.9% as \nat 31st March 2024, whilst it was 50.3% in March \n2023  (Source  –  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka).  The  \nlower inflation stabilised the purchasing power of \nthe  consumer  helping  predictability  of  demand.  \nStable  inflation  also  allowed  the  Group  to \npredict costs better, enabling the more efficient \nplanning  and  implementation  of    pricing  and  \ncost management strategies. \nFuture outlook\nThe  World  Bank  has  forecasted  a  1.7%  growth  in  \nGDP during the year 2024 with the improvement \nof overall economic performance of the country. \nThis  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  demand  for  the  \nentire product range offered by DIMO.\nMarket    interest    rates    continued    to    adjust    \ndownwards  in  line  with  eased  monetary  policy  \nand  administrative  measures  taken  to  reduce  \noverall market lending rates. There will be further \nspace  for  market  interest  rates,  especially  the  \nlending rates and yields to decline in the period \nahead,  in  line  with  the  current  rate  reduction  \npolicy (Source – Central Bank of Sri Lanka). This \nwill create more space for the Group to look for \nnew  opportunities  in  investment  and  business  \ndevelopment. \nAs   economic   activity   picks   up   and   import   \nrestrictions   are   phased   out,   it   is   natural   to   \nanticipate  an  increase  in  demand  for  foreign  \ncurrency  and  this  increased  demand  for  USD  \nwill put pressure on Sri Lanka Rupee. Hence LKR \nweakness  can  be  expected  in  next  few  quarters  \nof 2024 which will have a direct impact on Group \nimports.\nWith  the  increase  in  VAT  rates  and  a  pick-up  in  \neconomic activity, inflation may increase in the \nnear term but for a short period of time. Over the \nmedium-term  it  is  expected  to  stabilize  around  \n5%  supported  by  appropriate  policy  measures  \n(Source – Central Bank of Sri Lanka). The Board \nand  Management  of  the  Group  may  revisit  the  \ncompany's strategic plans and make adjustments \nto   capitalize   on   emerging   opportunities   or   \npossibilities in mitigating risks."

The \ndeparture   of   skilled   individuals   to   other   \ncountries, purportedly due to the challenging \neconomic  environment,  resulted  in  gaps  in  \nexpertise and experience within the Group. \nHuman Resource strategies deployed by the \nGroup  for  talent  retention  played  a  major  \nrole  in  mitigating  such  risks.  This  proactive  \napproach  towards  human  capital  retention  \ncan  contribute  to  the  company's  long-term  \nsuccess and competitiveness in the market. \nThe  challenging  economic  situation  in  Sri  \nLanka as a whole, had a significant impact \non  the  communities  where  our  businesses  \noperate.   \nTechnology is a powerful driver of innovation, \ngrowth, and transformation for businesses, \nenabling them to adapt to changing market \ndynamics, meet evolving customer needs, \nand seize new opportunities for success.   \nImpact to DIMO\nDuring   the   third   quarter   of   the   2023/24   \nfinancial year, DIMO was able to implement \nSAP   (Systems,   Applications,   and   Products   \nin  Data  processing)  as  the  Group’s  core  ERP  \n(Enterprise Resource Planning) system which \nwill have several significant impacts on DIMO's \noperations and business processes. \nSAP  integrates  various  business  functions  \nand  processes,  such  as  finance,  human \nresources,  supply  chain  management,  sales,  \nand procurement, into a single unified stream. \nThis   integration   will   allow   the   Group   to   \nstreamline  operations  and  improve  visibility  \nand collaboration across the organisation.   \nFuture outlook\nDIMO   will   focus   on   using   technology   to   \nstreamline operations and improve efficiency \nthrough      automation,      digitization,      and      \nprocess optimization. And the Group will look \nat implementing more SAP modules to make \nprocesses even more efficient. Overall, DIMO \nwill  use  technology  as  a  powerful  driver  of  \ninnovation,  growth,  and  transformation  for  \nbusinesses.\nFuture outlook\nDIMO  is  always  seeking  to  improve  Human  \nCapital      management      by      maintaining      \ntransparent  communication  with  employees  \nabout their challenges and plans, prioritizing \ntheir   well-being,   and   offering   employee   \nassistance programs to help employees cope \nwith financial stress, uncertainty and other \nchallenges. \nDIMO  is  also  playing  its  part  in  mitigating  \nthe  impact  of  economic  crisis  and  building  \nstronger,  more  vibrant  communities  for  the  \nfuture.\n29Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC  \n|\n  Annual Report 2023/24\nDragonflies possess the ability to \nmove in six different directions \nduring flight, demonstrating \ntheir remarkable flexibility and \nresponsiveness.\nOperating Context \nSection\nhttps://www.dimolanka.\ncom/2023-2024-dimo-annual-\nreport/url.php?id=11"

    "text": "30 Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC\nOperating Context \nOpening Remarks for Business Reports\nEnvironmentalLegal\nEnvironmental   factors   significantly \nimpact on our businesses in various ways, \ninfluencing the operations, strategies, and \nperformance of the Group.   \nImpact to DIMO\nExtremely  heavy  rains  prior  to  and  during  \nthe Maha season (September 2023 to March \n2024)  had  an  impact  on  cultivation  in  some  \nareas.  This  had  an  impact  on  the  sales  of  \ntractors,  agri-machinery  such  as  harvesters,  \nand of fertiliser, seeds and other agri inputs, \nthough not at a large scale.  \nTo the contrary, the renewable energy sector \nseeks  sunshine  as  opposed  to  rain,  as  all  \nthe  investments  are  in  the  generation  of  \nsolar power. This, in a way, becomes the risk \nmitigation factor in the case of a rainy season \nfailing, although the ideal situation sought is \nrainfall  at  the  correct  time,  which  will  make  \nboth segments deliver desired returns.\nFuture outlook\nWeather  patterns  play  a  significant  role \nin   agriculture.   Whilst   a   good   season   in   \nagriculture  presents  DIMO  with  significant \nshort-term opportunities, a season sans rain \ncould be a burden. Diversification is one risk \nmanagement  measure  that  is  adopted  to  \nmitigate  the  impact  of  such  a  risk.  The  Yala  \nseason  (May  2023  to  August  2023)  looks  \npromising with inter-monsoon rains already \nexperienced.  Several  investments  made  in  \nagriculture inputs and outputs are geared to \nface  the  Yala  season  and  the  Maha  season  \nlater this year. \nAs  a  business,  DIMO  is  subject  to  many \nlegislations and regulations. The legislations \nrelating  to  VAT  and  the  new  regulations \nissued  by  the  Colombo  Stock  Exchange \nare two aspects that would have an impact \non DIMO, though the latter is not likely to \nhave an impact from a business sense as \nit deals with matters relating to corporate \ngovernance.  In  addition,  legal  restrictions \nrelating  to  vehicle  imports  continue  to \nimpact DIMO.     \nImpact to DIMO\nThe   agriculture   segment   and   the   vehicle   \nsales  segment  were  the  worst  affected  from  \nthe  new  VAT  legislations  as  it  imposed  VAT  \non fertilizer, tractors and vehicle sales among \nothers,  which  were  not    previously  subject  \nto  VAT.  The  restrictions  on  vehicle  imports  \nlimited  our  business  in  vehicle  sales  only  to  \npre-owned  vehicles  and  vehicles  assembled  \nlocally by DIMO.\nAs   required,   DIMO   will   comply   with   all   \nnew    requirements    relating    to    corporate    \ngovernance  brought  about  by  the  Colombo  \nStock   Exchange   listing   rules   by   October   \n2024. This is apart from the requirements the \ncompany has already complied with.\nFuture outlook\nBased  on  the  announcements  made  so  far,  \nthe import of vehicles is likely to commence \nin  the  year  2025  and  any  relief  from  VAT  \nincreases  do  not  seem  to  be  forthcoming.  \nOverall, some legislation on the fiscal side \nproviding   relief   from   taxation   would   be   \nwelcome.\nThe movement and rotation of each \nwing can be changed independently of \neach other. This enables it to fly in any \ndirection, hover and perform flexible, \nacrobatic movements.\nResponsive Movement:\nDragonfly wings contain hundreds of sensory \nneurons, which enable them to control their \nflight even in unpredictable conditions. \na.

These  \nprojects are expected to support the country’s commitment to sourcing 70% of its energy from \nrenewable sources by 2030. Power transmission projects which were largely funded by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) experienced a \ndecline  in  funding  scarcity  during  the  economic  crisis,  resulting  in  the  market  for  infrastructure  \nprojects shrinking. Meanwhile, development projects at the east and west container terminals of \nthe Port of Colombo continued through the year.  \nSegment Strategy\nIn line with the DIMO corporate strategy, the segment followed a diversification strategy to \ninitiate backward integration by becoming a producer of power distribution panels. The segment \ncontinuously collaborates with principals to bring together DIMO’s technological expertise and \nworld-renowned brand names. We are able to customize products and services to meet specific \nrequirements of our customers and also to offer value engineered solutions, while moving into \nforeign markets to expand our customer base geographically. \n“To be a leading force in the transition to Green Energy through our best-in-class engineering \nsolutions  not  only  in  renewable  power  generation,  but  also  by  playing  a  pivotal  role  in  grid  \nupgradations required for the evacuation of power from renewable plants. There will be special \nfocus  on  the  building  services  space  to  offer  energy  performance  solutions  for  commercial  \n&  industrial  establishments  while  maintaining  market  leadership  position  in  the  Extra  Low  \nVoltage sphere”\nWijith Pushpawela \nExecutive Director – Power Engineering & Building Services\nGraph 05: Power Engineering & Building Services segment revenue \ncontribution to the Group\n11%\n2023/24\n13%\n2022/23\nDIMO collaborates with the most advanced, \nleading  global  partners  to  deliver  cutting-\nedge  solutions  for  building  and  energy-\nrelated challenges. Microgrids are the future \nof energy distribution in Sri Lanka.  \n“ADB   and   LECO   wanted   to   identify   a   \ntechnology   partner   who   will   also   be   \nthe   microgrid   implementer   for   all   the   \ndistribution utilities in Sri Lanka in future. \nSo  we  went  through  our  usual  selection  \nprocess  and  DIMO  was  selected  for  this  \nventure. At the outset I insisted that DIMO \nshould not be just another contractor, but \nshould  capture  this  technology  and  be  a  \ntechnology resource person in the future.\nThis was a very technical and difficult \nchallenge,  but  I'm  very  happy  to  tell  you  \nthat  today  DIMO  has  become  everything  \nwe expected. DIMO downloaded, captured, \nand   learnt   this   entire   technology   and   \nacquired  that  competency.  Today  your  \nengineers  can  independently  implement  \nany  microgrid  project,  anywhere  -  not  \nonly  in  Sri  Lanka.

As such, the financial capital \nrequirements  become  clear  only  once  \nthe marketing strategy is finalized. This \napproach   is   anticipated   to   generate   \nshort-term value\nThe   collaboration   strategy   primarily   \nrelies    on    relationship    capital    and    \nintellectual    capital.    The    need    for    \nfinancial  capital  will  vary  based  on \nthe  nature  of  the  collaboration.  This  \nstrategy    is    expected    to    generate    \nfinancial value across short, medium, \nand long term\nManufactured\nManufactured  capital  is  essential  for  \ndiversification  efforts.  Whether  for \nrelated     or     unrelated     investments     \nand  acquisitions,  financial  capital  is \nrequired    to    enhance    manufactured    \ncapital\nThe differentiation strategy is designed \nthrough  cost,  quality  and  delivery.  As  \nsuch,   manufactured   capital   plays   its   \npart  when  quality  products  have  to  be  \noffered at cost effective prices. Benefits \nfrom such investments are mostly short \nand medium term\nManufactured  capital  mostly  become  \nmaterial  when  our  principals  require  \nDIMO  to  comply  with  their  quality  and  \nhealth  &  safety  requirements.  In  such  \nsituations  manufactured  capital  may  \nbe important in the short term. It is also \nimportant   when   comfort   and   health   \n&  safety  is  afforded  to  anyone  who  \nsteps  into  our  premises  including  our  \nemployees and customers. \nHuman\nThe   increase   in   human   capital   is   a   \npositive consequence of diversification. \nTo attract expert talent for new ventures, \na trade-off with financial capital may be \nnecessary.  Enhanced  human  capital  is  \npoised to add value to DIMO in the short, \nmedium, and long term\nThe            differentiation            strategy            \nnecessitates   a   blend   of   fresh   and   \nseasoned   human   capital   to   develop   \ninnovative        marketing        strategies,        \nprocesses,   and   procedures,   thereby   \ngenerating financial value in the short \nand medium term\nThe   collaboration   strategy   relies   on   \nhuman  capital,  as  the  advantages  of  \ncollaboration  are  driven  by  the  people  \ninvolved\nSocial & \nrelationship \ncapital\nDiversification  relies  on  relationship \ncapital  to  form  partnerships  for  new  \nventures. This capital generates short-\nterm  value,  while  strong  relationships  \ncan provide long-term benefits.\nThe     dependence     on     social     and     \nrelationship  capital  for  differentiation  \nis perceived to be of a nature that is not \nconsidered material. \nEnhanced     social     and     relationship     \ncapital    is    essential    for    successful    \ncollaboration, as it is the key ingredient \nfor its success\nIntellectual \ncapital\nThe      strategy      requires      enhanced      \nintellectual      capital      to      optimize      \nsynergies  through  diversification, \nleading  to  greater  economies  of  scale  \nand improved financial performance.\nThe   strategy   is   supported   by   the   \nintellectual capital of the business. The \nexpertise and know-how of employees \ntransforms  the  differentiation  strategy  \ninto   action,   enhancing   both   human   \nand financial capital in the short and \nmedium term\nIntellectual    capital    plays    a    pivotal    \nrole  in  the  collaboration  strategy  as  it  \nbecomes a key value creator when two \nparties   collaborate.   Financial   capital,   \nsocial and relationship capital as well as \nhuman capital are the capital enablers \nfor  this  strategy  to  create  value  in  the  \nshort, medium and long-term.\nNatural\nWhile   natural   capital   might   not   be   \nthe     primary     driver     for     initiating     \ndiversification,  its  importance  can \nvary depending on the specific area of \ndiversification. For instance, transitioning \ninto agriculture necessitates substantial \nnatural  capital,  particularly  in  terms  of  \nland and water resources\nNatural capital, such as water and land, is \npredominantly  required  for  agriculture,  \nwhile    vehicle    aftersales    businesses    \nrequire  moderate  quantities.  However,  \nwhile  these  resources  are  essential  for  \nagriculture,  they  do  not  typically  serve  \nas differentiators in these sectors. \nOccasionally,     DIMO     may     leverage     \nnatural    capital,    such    as    land,    to    \nestablish  novel  partnerships  under  a  \ncollaboration  strategy.  However,  there  \nare currently no plans to do so.\nCapital Reports"

The   “IT   \nGovernance   Model”   is   regularly   reviewed,   \nwith    improvements    implemented    based    \non   learning,   industry   best   practices,   and   \nemerging     technologies.     However,     DIMO     \nwent  through  a  complete  review  of  the  “IT  \nGovernance    Framework”    during    2023/24    \ndue  to  the  significant  changes  to  its  ICT \nInfrastructure, application systems and other \ndigital  technologies.  The  rollout  of  SAP  was  \nthe most significant investment made in ICT \nduring the year.\nThe new governance framework was built on \n7 key principles identified to deliver optimum \nvalue to businesses.\n1. Strategic alignment with group Corporate \nGovernance \n2. Value delivery \n3. Innovation & competitiveness\n4. Risk management & business continuity. \n5. Performance management\n6. Resource management\n7. Compliance & legal obligations\nThe  “Group  IT  Steering  Committee”,  which  \nis  responsible  for  the  administration  of  the  \ngovernance framework went through a review \nduring  2023/24  to  facilitate  optimum  value  \ncreation   of   ICT   investments.   New   polices,   \nprocesses   and   best   practices   were   also   \nintroduced to optimise change management \nand  to  mitigate  risk  group-wide  risk  arising  \nfrom changes due to SAP rollout. Furthermore, \npolicies were brought in to govern “Data”, and \nthe “Digital Workplace”, and to drive industry \nspecific digital technologies.\nRefer page 25 - 26 to read more on our \nGroup Technology Strategy.\nCybersecurity Framework\nFunctionCategories\nGovernance Policies & ProceduresUnauthorized Access to Critical Information \nSystems (ERP ETC.)\nGroup Cyber Security Risk Profile\nData Theft\nProtect / Prevent\nFinancial Theft\nDetect\nBusiness Email Compromise\nRespond\nDenial of Service / Service Theft\nRecover\nData Integrity Loss\nRansomware\nBrand / Reputational Loss\nThis  framework  includes  governance  polices  to  manage  and  administer  Cyber  security  risks  \nincluding integrated reporting of incidents. The functions of the framework begin with building \nrisk profiles of the Group and its processes and formulating best practices to Protect, Detect, \nRespond  and  Recover  from  any  Cybersecurity  attacks.  Key  risk  categories  that  are  being  \naddressed  are  Unauthorized  Access  to  Critical  Information  Systems  (ERP  Etc.),  Data  Theft,  \nFinancial Theft, Business Email compromise, Denial of Service or Service Theft, Data Integrity \nLoss, Ransomware and Branding/Reputational losses.\nThe “Recover” function was given significant emphasis in 2023/24 resulting in Tier-4 data centre \ninfrastructure implementation at a Disaster Recovery site for all Critical Information Systems, \nwith  real-time  failover  functionality.  Incident  reporting  has  also  been  further  enhanced  with  \nthe  implementation  of  a  group-wide  support  ticketing  system  that  uses  a  “Managed  Engine”  \napplication system, which facilitates seamless capturing of all cybersecurity related incidents.\nThe cybersecurity management reports to the “IT Steering Committee” on monthly and/or need \nbasis. Their report highlights all categories and integrated impacts of incidents or threats, if any \nduring the period of reporting and also  any design level changes to functions of the framework.\nCybersecurity\nThe Group-wide rollout of Tier-1 ERP system SAP, implementation of Tier-4 Data centres and \nother new enterprise level Digital Technologies during 2023/24 resulted in a  new “Cybersecurity \nRisk Profile” for DIMO. Along with this new risk profile”, DIMO also introduced a new Cybersecurity \nframework to effectively manage these risks.\nFigure 8: Cybersecurity Framework\nCorporate Governance\nGRI: 2-9, 2-10, 2-11, 2-12, 2-16"

Organisations are now expected \nto    take    more    strategic    action    towards    \nembracing  a  circular  economy  –  addressing  \na    spectrum    of    issues    from    innovation,    \ntechnology, and data driven decision making \nto    sustainable    packaging    and    greening    \nsupply   chains.   Whilst   these   address   risks   \nassociated with sustainability, they also bring \nopportunities through innovations and brand \nenhancement. \nRisks  related  to  environmental  and  social  \naspects could harm and impair DIMO’s value \ncreation.    The    Company    must    therefore    \nmanage these risks whether DIMO is exposed \ndue  to  its  own  actions  or  due  to  events  \noccurring  outside  of  its  boundaries.  Looking  \nahead,  ESG  priorities  will  transform  supply  \nchains  while  sustainable  technologies  will  \nbe   leveraged   to   verify   end-to-end   ESG   \ncredentials. \nReporting  on  sustainability  is  governed  by  \nthe  laws,  regulatory  frameworks,  standards,  \nguidelines,  and  protocols  specified  on \npage  5.

His original intention was \nto  save  on  transport  costs  and  to  avoid  \nusing  public  transport  while  also  getting  \nhis    daily    exercise.    He    acknowledges    \nthat  cycling  to  work  makes  his  day  more  \npleasant and productive, while sticking to \na  routine  is  a  better  way  to  organise  his  \nday in the office. \nThe  challenge  is  to  get  the  recipe  right  \nto  be  able  to  cycle  to  work  regularly,  \nespecially  when  jobs  are  changed,  and  \nthe rains set in. He offers advice to those \ninterested in cycling to work. \nAmila  believes  that  putting  in  a  little  \neffort    to    create    facilities    that    are    \nconducive  to  specific  requirements \nwill  generate  more  interest  and  inspire  \nmore employees to cycle to office. This \nwill inspire others to take the challenge \nas well, creating a positive environment \nand more positive social impacts. \n\"Together,    we    continue    to    build    an    \nenvironment   that   not   only   enhances   \nprofessional   growth   but   also   ensures   \nthat  our  people  find  joy,  satisfaction \nand   purpose   in   their   daily   work.

As  the  first  step, \nwe  educated  and  trained  the  community  \nengaged    in    stealing    turtle    eggs    and    \nconverted  them  to  the  patrol  that  protects  \nthe nests during breeding season. To protect \nthe eggs from natural predators, we covered \nthe  nests  by  burrowing  cages  1½  feet  into  \nthe  ground,  a  harmless  in-situ  conservation  \nmethod   that   allows   turtle   hatchlings   to   \nemerge through the gaps of the cages. \nThe project today is a multiple partner case \nstudy. The project has 3 funding partners: \nDIMO  (3  km),  MAS  Intimates  (3  km)  and  \nCommercial  Bank  (11  km).  Its  key  objective  \nis   to   declare   the   site   a   protected   area   \nwith  data  collection  and  support  from  the  \nDepartment of Wildlife Conservation (DWC). \nThe   ongoing   project,   a   labour   of   love   \nspanning    over    12    years,    has    yielded    \nremarkable  results  in  safeguarding  turtle  \npopulations   and   their   nesting   habitats.   \nDIMO's  individual  efforts  have  led  to  the  \nprotection  of  1314  nests  and  153,815  eggs,  \nwith   an   impressive   75%-89%   hatchling   \nsurvival  rate.

This reclassification is based on the fact that the majority of sawdust waste is \ngenerated by the Agriculture Division from fertilizer sweepings. Furthermore, this waste is subsequently reused by third-party buyers in agricultural applications.\nIn the financial year 2023/24, the majority of waste was classified in the non-hazardous category, which is 86% of total waste generation. Notably, \nthis year marks the first year where fruit waste data was included, as this category of waste originated from a recently acquired new business - \nTropical Health Food (THF), and is being managed through composting initiatives.\nBasis for Measurement\nWaste is collected and segregated using colour coded bins placed at DIMO’s premises. Waste is measured as the sum of all the waste disposed at \ndifferent locations based on the weight logs and invoices received for paid waste disposal and collectors. Waste is disposed for reusing, recycling, \nor for energy recovery by incineration - through suppliers approved by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA).  \n2.5  Emission\nTable 50: Carbon Emission from Operations\nDescriptionUnits2023/242022/232021/22\nConsumptionEmission\n(tCO₂e)\nConsumptionEmission\n(tCO₂e) \nConsumptionEmission\n(tCO₂e) \nScope 1551171,765\nDiesel For Generators Ltr6,5421843,656117774,5161,765\nDiesel for VehiclesLtr12,18633--\nPetrol for VehiclesLtr1,8734--\nScope 21,799*7962,095\nElectricitykWh2,534,3071,7991,120,8467963,112,6852,095\nScope 33,034.42,690.61,228\nDiesel for Vehicles - DeliveryLtr67,04718015,209407116,015266\nPetrol for Vehicles - DeliveryLtr1650.42870.6256,027670\nPetrol for Vehicles - EmployeesLtr1,157,0622,673948,8962,192163,015278\nBusiness Travel1819114\nTotal Emission4,8883,6045,088\nThe increase in electricity consumption during the 2023/24 financial year compared to the 2022/23 financial year is due to the inclusion of a \nlarger number of DIMO premises in the emission calculations.

Our   responsibilities   under   those   standards   are   further   \ndescribed  in  the  Auditors'  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the  Financial  \nStatements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in \naccordance  with  the  Code  of  Ethics  for  professional  Accountants  issued  \nby CA Sri Lanka (\"Code of Ethics\"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical \nresponsibilities in accordance with the Code of Ethics. We believe that the \naudit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide \na basis for our opinion.\nKey Audit Matters\nKey  audit  matters  are  those  matters  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  \nwere  of  most  significance  in  our  audit  of  the  company  financial \nstatements and the consolidated financial statements for the current \nperiod. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the \ncompany financial statements and the consolidated financial statements \nas a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a \nseparate opinion on these matters. \nRevenue Recognition\nSee note 3.7 for Summary of significant Accounting, Judgments, Estimates and Assumptions and note 4.1 for accounting policy and information\nRisk DescriptionOur Response\nThe  Group  carry  out  its  business  operations  in  different  sectors  which  \nresult in high volume of revenue transactions in different revenue streams \nwhich  requires  judgment  in  some  of  the  revenue  transactions  in  order  to  \ndetermine  the  timing  and  the  amount  of  revenue  recognition.  Further,  in  \naccordance with Sri Lanka Auditing Standards (SLAuS) , there is a presumed \nfraud risk relating to revenue recognition .\nRevenue recognition of certain items of the Group and the Company require \njudgement which will increase the risk of material misstatement of revenue, \ncontract liabilities and other related balances.\nWe consider this as a key audit matter because of the significant judgment \nassociated  with  the  appropriate  recognition  of  revenue  in  the  correct  \naccounting period.\nOur audit procedures included;  \n yObtaining an understanding of and assessing the design, \nimplementation and operating effectiveness of management key \ninternal controls involved in the revenue recognition including the key \nIT controls relating to revenue recognition.\n yPerforming detailed analysis of revenue, testing the timing of its \nrecognition and accuracy of the amounts recognized for significant \nrevenue streams.\n yReviewing the adequacy, relevance and accuracy of the accounting \npolicies and disclosures in the financial statements."

The  carrying  amount  of  each  investment  in  subsidiaries  and  \nrelated  goodwill  have  been  tested  for  impairment  as  individual  Cash  Generating  \nUnits. The carrying amount of these investments and goodwill could be materially \nmisstated if inappropriate judgments and estimates were used by the management \nin calculating the recoverable amount for each cash generating unit (‘CGU’) as part \nof their impairment assessment.\nWe identified assessment of impairment of investment in subsidiaries and Goodwill \nas a key audit matter due to significant degree of management judgment involved \nin making this assessment and in forecasting the future cash flows of the companies \nwhich could have significant impact on the financial statements. Further, impact \nprevailing   volatile   macro-economic   environment   on   the   business   operations   \nresulted  in  increased  estimates  and  judgements  involved  in  the  assessment  of  \nimpairment of investment in subsidiaries and Goodwill.\nOur audit procedures included,\n yObtaining an understanding of management’s impairment \nassessment process.\n yEvaluating the indications of possible impairment of \ninvestments in subsidiaries and Goodwill.\n yObtaining the forecasted cash flow projections of the \nsubsidiaries, equity accounted investees and assessing \nthe reasonableness of the forecasts and challenging the \nassumptions used in the valuation.\n yReviewing the effectiveness of management’s process in \ndeveloping these forecasts by comparing the actual financial \nresults against previous projections.\n yAssessing the adequacy of disclosures made in the financial \nstatements with the relevant accounting standards.\nOther Information\nManagement   is   responsible   for   the   other   information.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a \nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SLAuSs will always \ndetect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  \nfrom  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  \naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SLAuSs, we exercise professional \njudgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We \nalso:\n yIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial \nstatements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit \nprocedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that \nis sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The \nrisk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud \nis higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve \ncollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the \noverride of internal control.\n yObtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit \nin order to design audit procedures that are     appropriate in the \ncircumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on \nthe effectiveness of the Company and the Group’s internal control.\n yEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the \nreasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures \nmade by management.\n yConclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the \ngoing concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence \nobtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events \nor conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability \nto continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material \nuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' \nreport to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such \ndisclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions \nare based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the \nGroup to cease to continue as a going concern.\n yEvaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the \nfinancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nfinancial statements represent the underlying transactions and \nevents in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n yObtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial \ninformation of the entities or business activities within the Group to \nexpress an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are \nresponsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the \ngroup audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among \nother matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant \naudit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control \nthat we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we \nhave complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, \nand to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may \nreasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, \nactions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we \ndetermine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of \nthe financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key \naudit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless \nlaw or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in \nextremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be \ncommunicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing \nso would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits \nof such communication.\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\nAs  required  by  section  163  (2)  of  the  Companies  Act  No.  07  of  2007,  we  \nhave obtained all the information and explanations that were required for \nthe audit and, as far as appears from our examination, proper accounting \nrecords have been kept by the Company.\nCA Sri Lanka membership number of the engagement partner responsible \nfor signing this independent auditors' report is 3272.\nChartered Accountants\nColombo, Sri Lanka \n20th June 2024"

In making this assessment, the Management has considered the \npotential  negative  impact  that  the  current  economic  conditions  could  \nbring  to  the  business  operation  of  the  Group.  In  doing  so,  Management  \nhas  prepared  estimates  of  performance  and  the  forecasted  liquidity  \nbased   on   the   likely,   worst,   and   best-case   scenarios   by   considering   \navailable information and economic forecasts and the available resources \nand assets at the Group’s disposal. \nThe  Board  believes  that  the  Group  has  adequate  financial  strength, \nresources,  and  business  plans  to  continue  to  operate  the  business  as  a  \ngoing  concern  for  the  foreseeable  future  by  mitigating  the  risks  arising  \nfrom the current economic conditions.\nTherefore, the Board is of the view that the Financial Statements for the \nyear ended 31 March 2024 should be prepared and presented as a going \nconcern. \n3.4  Functional and Presentation Currency\nThe  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  are  presented  in  Sri  Lankan  \nRupees (LKR), which is the currency of the primary economic environment \nin which the reporting entity operates.

The  management  makes  \nestimates   and   judgements   based   on   current   knowledge,   historical   \nexperience and various other assumptions that are held to be reasonable \nunder  the  circumstances.  However,  actual  results  may  differ  from  these  \njudgements  and  estimates.  Estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  \nreviewed on an ongoing basis and revisions to accounting estimates are \nrecognised prospectively.\nThe  key  assumptions  concerning  the  future  and  other  key  sources  of  \nestimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk \nof causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and \nliabilities within the next financial year, are also described in the individual \nnotes to the Financial Statements. The Group based its assumptions and \nestimates  on  parameters  available  when  the  Consolidated  Financial  \nStatements   were   prepared.   Existing   circumstances   and   assumptions   \nabout future developments, however, may change due to market changes \nor  circumstances  arising  that  are  beyond  the  control  of  the  Group.  Such  \nchanges are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\nJudgements,  estimates  and  assumptions  made  by  management  which  \nhave the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in these \nConsolidated Financial Statements are described in the following Notes.\nTable 70: Accounting Policies\nAccounting PolicyNote\nRevenue Recognition4.1\nImpairment of non financial assets 3.9.3\nIncome tax and deferred tax assets and liabilities4.24/4.29\nUseful life time of property, plant and equipment4.9\nRevaluation of property, plant and equipment 4.9\nProvision for impairment of trade receivables 4.16\nEmployee benefits4.23\nWarranty provisions4.27\nProvision on inventories4.15\nRight-of-use assets and lease liabilities4.10\nCommitments and Contingencies5.2\nConsolidation3.9.1\nEquity accounted investees3.9.1\nAcquisition of subsidiaries3.9.1\nImpairment test on goodwill3.9.1\n3.8  Material Accounting Policies\nSummary  of  material  accounting  policies  are  presented  along  with  the  \nrelevant individual notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n3.8.1  Changes in material accounting policies during the \nyear\nDeferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single \ntransaction\nThe Group and the Company adopted Deferred Tax related to Assets and \nLiabilities  arising  from  a  Single  Transaction  (Amendments  to  LKAS  12)  \nfrom 1 April 2023. Following the amendments, the Group has recognised a \nseparate deferred tax asset in relation to its lease liabilities and a deferred \ntax  liability  in  relation  to  its  right-of-use  assets.  However,  there  was  no  \nimpact on the statement of financial position because the balances \nqualify for offset under LKAS 12. There was also no impact on the opening \nretained  earnings  as  at  1  April  2023  as  a  result  of  the  change.  The  key  \nimpact for the Group relates to disclosure of the deferred tax assets and \nliabilities recognised.\nThose  accounting  policies  presented  with  each  note,  have  been  applied  \nconsistently by the Group to the all periods presented in this report.\nSet out below is an index of the material accounting policies, the details \nof which are available on the page indicated.\nTable 71: Mateiral Accounting Policies\nNote Accounting PolicyPage No.\n4.1Revenue184\n4.2Operating Segments187\n4.3Other Operating Income192\n4.4Net Finance Cost192\n4.5Profit Before Tax193\n4.6Taxation194\n4.7Earnings Per Share-Basic and Diluted196\n4.8Dividends196\n4.9Property, Plant and Equipment197\n4.10Right-of-Use Assets202\n4.11Intangible Assets and Goodwill 203\n4.12Investments in Subsidiaries and Equity-Accounted \nInvestees205\n4.13Financial Assets and Liabilities210\n4.14Equity Securities218\n4.15Inventories219\n4.16Trade and Other Receivables220\n4.17Other Current Assets222\n4.18Cash and Cash Equivalents223\n4.19Stated Capital223\n4.20Revenue Reserve224\n4.21Other Components of Equity224"

The  consideration  \ntransferred  in  the  acquisition  is  generally  measured  at  fair  value,  as  are  \nthe identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested \nannually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in \nStatement of Profit or Loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed \nas incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.\nThe  consideration  transferred  does  not  include  amounts  related  to  the  \nsettlement  of  pre-existing  relationships.  Such  amounts  are  generally  \nrecognised in Profit or Loss.\nIf  the  business  combination  is  achieved  in  stages,  any  previously  held  \nequity  interest  is  remeasured  at  its  acquisition  date  fair  value  and  any  \nresulting gain or loss is recognised in Profit or Loss.\nAny  contingent  consideration  is  measured  at  fair  value  at  the  date  of  \nacquisition.  If  an  obligation  to  pay  contingent  consideration  that  meets  \nthe definition of a financial instrument within the scope of SLFRS 9 is \nclassified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted \nfor within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured \nat  fair  value  at  each  reporting  date  and  subsequent  changes  in  the  fair  \nvalue of the contingent consideration are recognised in Profit or Loss.\nb) Subsidiaries \nSubsidiaries  are  investees  that  are  controlled  by  the  Company.  The  \nCompany ‘Controls’ an investee if it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable \nreturns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect \nthose returns through its power over the investee. At each reporting date \nthe  Company  reassesses  whether  it  controls  an  investee  if  facts  and  \ncircumstances  indicate  that  there  are  changes  to  one  or  more  of  the  \nelements of control mentioned above. The Financial Statements of all the \nsubsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from \nthe date on which control commences until the date when control ceases.\nA  change  in  the  ownership  interest  of  a  subsidiary,  without  a  loss  of  \ncontrol, is accounted for as an equity transaction.\nIf  the  Group  loses  control  over  a  subsidiary,  it  derecognises  the  related  \nassets  (including  goodwill),  liabilities,  non-controlling  interest  and  other  \ncomponents  of  equity  while  any  resultant  gain  or  loss  is  recognised  in  \nprofit or loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value.\nConsolidation of subsidiaries with different accounting periods\nThe  Financial  Statements  of  the  parent  Company  and  subsidiaries  are  \nprepared to a common financial year ending 31st March, except for DIMO \nLanka  Company  Limited  and  United  DIMO  Company  Limited  whose \nfinancial year ends on 30th September. These subsidiaries prepared \nfinancial information as at 31st March 2024 for consolidation purpose. The \nreason for using different reporting periods by the above two subsidiaries \nlocated in Myanmar is due to the requirement imposed by the Government \nof Myanmar.  The Financial Statements of the parent and subsidiaries are \nprepared using uniform accounting policies. \nThere are no significant restrictions (other than obtaining approval from \nthe  Central  Bank  of  the  relevant  country)  on  the  ability  of  subsidiaries  \nto transfer funds to the Company (the \"Parent\") in the form of cash \ndividend or repayment of loans and advances except for the subsidiaries \nincorporated in Myanmar. The current regulations in Myanmar are unclear \nabout remittance of cash dividends or repayment of loans and advances \nbeing remitted out of the country.   \nSection 3 - Basis of Accounting"

The difference between fair \nvalue  of  any  consideration  paid  and  the  relevant  share  acquired  of  the  \ncarrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in Equity.\nA list of material non -controlling interest is set out in Note 4.12.4 to the \nFinancial Statements\nd) Measurement of goodwill and impairment\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the aggregate \nof  the  consideration  transferred  and  the  amount  recognised  for  non-\ncontrolling   interests)   and   any   previous   interest   held   over   the   net   \nidentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the \nnet assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, \nthe Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets \nacquired  and  all  of  the  liabilities  assumed  and  reviews  the  procedures  \nused to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If \nthe re-assessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets \nacquired  over  the  aggregate  consideration  transferred,  then  the  gain  is  \nrecognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss.\nAfter initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated \nimpairment  losses.  For  the  purpose  of  impairment  testing,  goodwill  \nacquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated \nto each of the Group’s cash generating units that are expected to benefit \nfrom the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of \nthe acquiree are assigned to those units.\nGoodwill  is  tested  for  impairment  annually  as  at  31  March  and  when  \ncircumstances   indicate   that   the   carrying   value   may   be   impaired.   \nImpairment  is  determined  for  goodwill  by  assessing  the  recoverable  \namount of each CGU (or Group of CGUs) to which the goodwill relates. \nWhen the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, \nan impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to goodwill \ncannot be reversed in future periods.\ne) Equity-Accounted Investees\nInterests in the Joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. \nThey are initially recognised at cost, which includes transaction costs, in \nterms  of  Sri  Lanka    Accounting  Standards  –  LKAS  28  on  “Investments  in  \nAssociates  and  Joint  Ventures”.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  the  \nConsolidated Financial Statements include the Group’s share of the profit \nor loss and other comprehensive income of equity-accounted investees, \nuntil the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases.\nA  Joint  venture  is  an  arrangement  in  which  the  Group  has  joint  control,  \nwhereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather \nthan rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\nThe Financial Statements of the joint venture are prepared for the same \nreporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to \nbring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it \nis necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its joint \nventure.  At  each  reporting  date,  the  Group  determines  whether  there  is  \nobjective  evidence  that  the  investment  in  the  joint  venture  is  impaired.  \nIf there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment \nas  the  difference  between  the  recoverable  amount  of  the    joint  venture  \nand its carrying value, and then recognises the loss within ‘Share of profit \nor loss of equity accounted investees’ in the Statement of Profit or Loss.\nUpon loss of significant influence over the  joint control , the Group \nmeasures  and  recognises  any  retained  investment  at  its  fair  value.  Any  \ndifference  between  the  carrying  amount  of  the    joint  venture  upon  loss  \nof significant influence or joint control and the fair value of the retained \ninvestment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in the Statement of \nProfit or Loss\nExcept DIMO Coastline (Private) Limited Financial Statements of the joint \nventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.\nEquity  accounted  investees    are  disclosed  in  Note  4.12.5  to  the  Financial  \nStatements.\nf) Transactions Eliminated on Consolidation\nIntra-group   balances   and   transactions,   and   any   unrealised   income   \nand  expenses  arising  from  intra-group  transactions  are  eliminated  in  \npreparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Unrealised losses are \nalso  eliminated  in  the  same  way  as  unrealised  gains,  but  only  to  the  \nextent that there is no evidence of impairment. A change in the ownership \ninterest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an \nequity transaction.\n3.9.2  Foreign Currency\nTransactions and Balances\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency \nat the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetary \nassets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into \nthe  functional  currency  at  the  exchange  rate  prevailing  at  the  reporting  \ndate."

If  any  such  indication  \nexists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested \nannually for impairment. Refer note 3.9.1 (d) for goodwill impairment.\nThe ‘recoverable amount’ of an asset is the greater of its value in use and \nits  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell.  ‘Value  in  use’  is  based  on  the  estimated  \nfuture cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax \ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value \nof money and the risks specific to the asset. The fair value less costs to \nsell  calculation  is  based  on  available  data  from  an  active  market,  in  an  \narm’s  length  transaction,  of  similar  assets  or  observable  market  prices  \nless incremental costs for disposing of the asset. For impairment testing, \nassets  that  cannot  be  tested  individually  are  grouped  together  into  the  \nsmallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use \nthat is largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets.\nAn  impairment  loss  is  recognised  if  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  \nexceeds   its   recoverable   amount.   Impairment   losses   are   recognised   \nin  Profit  or  Loss  except  for  properties  previously  revalued  with  the \nrevaluation  taken  to  Other  Comprehensive  Income,  For  such  properties,  \nthe  impairment  is  recognised  in  Other  Comprehensive  Income  up  to  \nthe  amount  of  any  previous  revaluation.  Impairment  losses  recognised  \nin  prior  periods  are  assessed  at  each  reporting  date  for  any  indication  \nthat  the  loss  has  decreased  or  no  longer  exists.  An  impairment  loss  is  \nreversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine \nthe recoverable amount. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not \nreversed.  For  other  assets,  an  impairment  loss  is  reversed  only  to  the  \nextent that the asset’s carrying amount that would have been determined \n(net of depreciation or amortisation) had no impairment loss recognised \nin prior years.\nThe  parent,  subsidiaries  and  joint  ventures  have  access  to  adequate  \nfunding to continue their business operations. Based on the assessments \nmade  to  the  recoverable  amounts  of  non-financial  assets,  including \ninvestments  in  subsidiaries,  there  were  no  indications  that  require  an  \nadjustment in the financial statements other than disclosure made in \n4.12.2.\n3.9.3.1.  Right to Use of Assets\nThe  Group  does  not  foresee  any  impairment  of  the  right  to  use  assets  \ndue  to  the  prevailing  and  anticipate  effects  of  the  current  economic  \nconditions  and  does  not  anticipate  discontinuation  of  any  asset  before  \nthe previously expected date, for which the Group possesses the right to \nuse. Lease liabilities are not reassessed as there are no known moratoriums \nreceived for the lease payments so far.\n3.9.4  Statement of Cash Flows\nThe  Statement  of  Cash  Flows  has  been  prepared  by  using  the  ‘Indirect  \nMethod’ of preparing cash flows in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting \nStandard-LKAS 7 on ‘Statement of Cash Flows’. Cash and cash equivalents \nas referred to in the Statement of Cash Flows comprised of those items as \nexplained in  Note 4.18 and 4.22.2\nSection 3 - Basis of Accounting"

The  Group  plans  to  apply  these  \namendments to the standards from their effective dates:\nA summary of the requirements stipulated by the amendments and their \npossible impact on financial statements, when implemented, is presented \nin the table below;\nTable 73: Summary of standards issued but not yet effective\nNew or amended \nStandards\nSummary of requirementsPossible impact on Financial \nStatements\nAmendments to LKAS 1 - \nClassification of Liabilities \nas Current or Non-current \nand Non current liabilities \nwith Covenants \nThe  amendments,    aim  to  clarify  the  requirements  on  determining  whether  the  \nliability  is  current  or  Non-current,  and  require  new  disclosures  for  non-  current  \nliabilities that are subject to future covenants. The Standard  will become effective \nfor the Group from 1 April 2024. \nThe Group is assessing the \npotential impact on its Financial \nStatements resulting from the \napplication of these amendments. \nNo material impact is expected on \nadoption.\nAmendments to LKAS 7 and \nSLFRS 7 - Supplier Finance \nArrangements \nThe  amendments  introduced  new  disclosures  relating  to  supplier  finance \narrangement that assist users of the financial statements  to assess the effect of \nthese arrangements on an entity's liabilities and cash flow and on an entity's exposure \nto liquidity risk. The Standard will become effective for the Group from 1 April 2024. \nAmendments to SLFRS 16 - \nLease liability in a Sale and \nLeaseback\nThe amendments specifically affect seller-lessee accounting in sale and leaseback \ntransactions that qualify as a sale under SLFRS 16, especially those involving variable \nlease  payments  not  based  on  an  index  or  rate.  They  modify  how  a  seller-lessee  \naccounts for these leasebacks, preventing recognition of gains on retained rights of \nuse due to lease term modifications or changes which previously could occur when \nvariable payments not defined as ‘lease payments’ were excluded. The Standard will \nbecome effective for the Group from 1 April 2024. \nSLFRS S1 General \nRequirements for \nDisclosure of Sustainability \nrelated Financial \nInformation\nThe  standard  requires  an  entity  to  disclose  information  about  its  sustainability-\nrelated  risks  and  opportunities  that  is  useful  to  primary  users  of  general-purpose  \nfinancial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.\nThese standards will become \neffective for the Group from 1 \nApril 2025.

    "text": "184Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC\nSection 4 - Specific Accounting \nPolicies and Notes\nThis section provides specific accounting policies and basis of accounting estimates in relation to the reported \nvalues in the Financial Statements with additional Notes and explanations thereon.\n4.1  Revenue\nAccounting Policy\nThe Group recognises revenue from contracts with customers when control \nof the goods or services is transferred to the customer at an amount that \nreflects the consideration that the Group is to be entitled in exchange for \nthose goods or services. Determining the timing of the transfer of control of \ngoods or services, at a point in time or over time, requires judgments taking \ninto consideration the nature of goods or services that Group offers.\nSome contracts include multiple deliverables. Where the contracts include \nmultiple  performance  obligations,  the  transaction  price  will  be  allocated  \nto each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. \nWhere these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on \nexpected cost plus margin.\nThe  Group  disaggregate  its  revenue  into  following  categories  based  on  \nthe nature, amount , timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows \narising from contracts with customers.\nSale of Goods\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when \ncontrol  of  the  goods  is  transferred  to  the  customer,  usually  on  delivery  \nof  the  goods.    Sales  are  measured  at  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  \nreceived  or  receivable  excluding  amounts  collected  on  behalf  of  third  \nparties  (e.g.  Sales  taxes)  and  variable  consideration  (e.g.  discounts  and  \nrebates).  The  Group  estimates  an  amount  of  variable  consideration  by  \nusing the expected value method which is the sum of probability weighted \namounts in a range of possible considerations.\nRendering of Services\nRevenue from rendering of services is recognised when the Group satisfies \nall performance obligations by transferring a promised service to a customer.\nConstruction Related Contracts\nRevenue   from   construction   related   contracts   is   recognised   upon   \nsatisfaction of a performance obligation agreed in the contract. At contract \ninception, the Group determines whether it satisfies the performance \nobligation over time or at a point in time. The revenue recognition occurs \nat a point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer. \nFor each performance obligation satisfied over time, the Group recognises \nthe  revenue  over  time  by  measuring  the  progress  towards  complete  \nsatisfaction of that performance obligation.\nThe progress is assessed based on surveys of work performed. When the \noutcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract \nrevenue  is  recognised  only  to  the  extent  of  contract  costs  incurred  that  \nare likely to be recoverable.  An expected loss on a contract is recognised \nimmediately in profit or loss.\nService Support Income \nService  support  income  which  is  included  in  revenue  represents  income  \nreceived from foreign principals on indent sales. Such income is recognised \non  an  accrual  basis  at  the  time  of    satisfying  performance  obligation  \nrelating to the service support provided by the Group.\n4.1.1  Disaggregation of Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn the following tables, revenue from contract with customers is disaggregated by nature of the product and timing of revenue recognition.\n4.1.1.1.

This  restriction  has  now  been  extended  \nby the government until further notice. Until the import restrictions are \nremoved,  there  are  no  prospects  of  new  stocks  being  received  by  the  \nCompany  except  for  any  vehicles  assembled  in  Sri  Lanka.

Income  tax  expense  is  \nrecognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss, except to the extent it relates \nto  items  recognised  directly  in  equity  or  other  comprehensive  income  in  \nwhich case it is recognised in equity or in other comprehensive income.\nThe Group applied IFRIC Interpretation 23 “Uncertainty over Income Tax \nTreatment” in the determination of taxable profit, tax bases, unused tax \nlosses,  unused  tax  credits  and  tax  rates,  when  there  is  uncertainty  over  \nthe income tax treatment.\nCurrent tax\nCurrent  tax  assets  and  liabilities  consist  of  amounts  expected  to  be  \nrecovered from or paid to the taxation authorities in respect of the current \nas well as prior years. The amount of current tax receivable or payable is \nthe best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that \nreflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. Accordingly, provision \nfor taxation is based on the profit for the year adjusted for taxation \npurposes in accordance with the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No. \n24 of 2017 and subsequent amendments thereto, at the rates specified in \nNote  4.6.1 to the Financial Statements.\nAccounting Estimate\nThe Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax, based on an estimate \nof  taxable  income.  Given  the  wide  range  of  business  relationships  and  \nthe long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, \ndifferences  arising  between  the  actual  results  and  the  assumptions  \nmade,  or  future  changes  to  such  assumptions,  could  necessitate  future  \nadjustments to tax expense already recorded. Where the final tax outcome \nof such matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, \nsuch differences will impact the income and deferred tax amounts in the \nperiod in which the determination is made.\nDeferred Tax\nA detail disclosure of accounting policies and estimate of deferred tax are \navailable in Note 4.24.\nSales Tax\nRevenue, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales \ntax except:\n yWhere the sales tax incurred on the purchase of an asset or service is \nnot recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax \nis recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of \nthe expense item as applicable; and\n yWhere receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales \ntax included.\nThe net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation \nauthority is included as part of receivables or payables in the statement \nof financial position.\nValue  Added  Tax  (VAT)  rate  on  applicable  goods  and  services  increased  \nfrom 15% to 18% starting 01st January 2024. During the previous year and \nprior  to  aforesaid  period,  12%  applied  up  to  31st  August  2023  and  15%  \napplied  from  01st  September  2023.  The  VAT  threshold  for  businesses  \nwas  also  reduced  to  an  annual  turnover  of  LKR  60  million  (from  LKR  80  \nmillion) and LKR 15 million per taxable period (from LKR 20 million) w.e.f. \n01st January 2024. \nSocial  Security  Contribution  Levy  (SSCL)  shall  be  paid  by  any  person  \ncarrying  on  the  business  of  manufacturing,  supply  of  services  or  whole/\nretail sales, on the liable turnover specified in the Second Schedule of the \nSocial Security Contribution Levy Act No. 25 of 2022, at the rate of 2.5%, \nwith effect from 1st October 2022 and subsequent amendments thereto. \n \n \n4.6.1  Tax Rate\nTable 76: Income tax rates of Group and Company\nName of the EntityCountry of \nDomicile\nTax Rates\n2024\n2023\nFirst Six\nmonths\nSecond Six\nmonths\nDiesel & Motor Engineering PLCSri Lanka30%14% / 18% / 24%30%\nDIMO (Private) Limited, DIMO Lifeline (Private) Limited, DIMO Industries (Private) Limited, \nDIMO Travels (Private) Limited and MoveFlex (Private) Limited, Mansel Ceylon (Private) \nLimited and Associated Laboratories (Private) Limited\nSri Lanka30%24%30%\nVirgin Oil International (Private) Limited and Tropical Health Foods (Private) LimitedSri Lanka30%14% / 24%30%\nPlantChem (Private) Limited and Plant Seeds (Private) LimitedSri Lanka30%24% / 18%30%\nDIMO Lanka Company Limited and United DIMO Company LimitedMyanmar22%22%22%\nDIMO Bangladesh (Pvt) LtdBangladesh27.5%27.5%27.5%\nDIMO Global Pte.

Cost  includes  expenditure  that  \nis  directly  attributable  to  the  acquisition  of  the  asset  and  subsequent  \ncosts (as explained under subsequent cost) . The cost of self-constructed \nassets include the cost of materials, direct labour, any other costs directly \nattributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended \nuse,  the  costs  of  dismantling  and  removing  the  items  and  restoring  the  \nsite  on  which  they  are  located  and  borrowing  costs  that  are  directly  \nattributable to the asset under construction.\nIf significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have \ndifferent  useful  lives,  then  they  are  accounted  for  as  separate  items  \n(major components) of property, plant and equipment.\nPurchased software which is integral to the functionality of the related \nequipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.\nCost Model\nAll property, plant and equipment except freehold land, are recorded at cost, \nless accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.\nWhen an asset’s carrying value is higher than it’s recoverable amount, \nthe carrying value is written down to its recoverable amount (Please refer \nNote 3.9.3 - Impairment of non-financial assets).\nRevaluation Model\nThe Group applies the revaluation model for the entire class of freehold \nland  for  measurement  after  initial  recognition.  The  Group  policy  is  to  \nrevalue  all  freehold  land  by  an  independent  professional  valuer  every  \nthree  years  or  when  there  is  a  substantial  difference  between  the  fair  \nvalue and the carrying amount.\nOn  revaluation  of  an  asset,  any  increase  in  the  carrying  amount  is  \nrecognised in revaluation reserve in equity through Other Comprehensive \nIncome or used to reverse a previous loss on revaluation of the same asset, \nwhich was charged to Profit or Loss. In this circumstance, the increase is \nrecognised  as  income  only  to  the  extent  of  the  previous  write  down  in  \nvalue. Any decrease in the carrying amount is recognised as an expense \nin Profit or Loss or charged to revaluation reserve in equity through Other \nComprehensive Income, only to the extent of any credit balance existing \nin the revaluation reserve in respect of that asset. Any balance remaining \nin the revaluation reserve in respect of an asset, is transferred directly to \nretained earnings upon disposal of the asset.\nThe  freehold  lands  were  valued  by  reference  to  transactions  involving  \nproperties of a similar nature.\nSubsequent Costs\nSubsequent  expenditure  is  capitalised  only  when  it  is  probable  that  the  \nfuture economic benefits of the expenditure will flow to the Group and \nits  cost  can  be  measured  reliably.  The  costs  of  day  to  day  servicing  of  \nproperty, plant and equipment are expensed as incurred.\nDerecognition\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal \nor when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain \nor loss arising on derecognition of the asset is recognised in Profit or Loss \nin the year the asset is derecognised.\nBorrowing costs\nBorrowing   costs   that   are   directly   attributable   to   the   acquisition,   \nconstruction  or  production  of  a  qualifying  asset  are  capitalised  as  part  \nof  the  cost  of  the  qualifying  asset.  A  qualifying  asset  is  an  asset  which  \ntakes  a  substantial  period  of  time  to  get  ready  for  its  intended  use  or  \nsale.  Capitalisation  of  borrowing  costs  ceases  when  substantially  all  the  \nactivities  necessary  to  prepare  the  qualifying  asset  for  its  intended  use  \nare completed. Other borrowing costs are recognised in Profit or Loss in \nthe period in which they are incurred.\nCapital work-in-progress\nCapital work-in-progress is stated in the Statement of Financial Position \nat  cost,  including  borrowing  costs,  less  any  accumulated  impairment  \nlosses. Capital work-in-progress would be transferred to the relevant asset \nwhen it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of \noperating in the manner intended by management (i.e. available for use).\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is calculated to write-off the cost of items of property, plant \nand  equipment  less  their  estimated  residual  values  using  the  straight-\nline method over their estimated useful lives and is recognised in Profit or \nLoss. Freehold land is not depreciated.\nDepreciation  of  an  asset  begins  from  the  date  it  is  available  for  use  or  in  \nrespect of self constructed assets from the date that the asset is completed \nand ready for use. Depreciation ceases at the earlier of the date that the \nasset is classified as held for sale or the date that the asset is derecognised.\nThe estimated useful lives of PPE are as follows:\nTable 77: Useful Lives of Property Plant and Equipment\nClass of AssetYear\nBuildings and Premises36 - 40\nBuildings on leasehold land and \nimprovements\nOver the remanning lease \nperiod\nPlant and machinery 04-20\nTools and implements03-04\nMotor vehicles03-04\nFurniture and fittings04-13\nElectrical fixtures and office equipment04-10\nComputer hardware and accessories02-04\nResidual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are reviewed at \neach financial year end and adjusted if appropriate."

The Group applies \njudgements  in  evaluating  the  level  of  certainty  whether  the  option  of  \nrenewing  the  lease  exits  or  otherwise.    That  is,  it  considers  all  relevant  \nfactors that create an economic benefits for it to exercise either the \nrenewal or termination options.

Right-of-Use assets are measured at cost less any \naccumulated  depreciation  and  impairment  losses  and  adjusted  for  any  \nre-measurement  of  lease  liabilities.

The costs of intangible assets acquired in a business combination \nare  recognised  at  their  fair  value  at  the  date  of  acquisition.  Following  \ninitial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated \namortisation   and   accumulated   impairment   losses,   if   any.   Internally   \ngenerated intangibles, excluding capitalised  development costs, are not \ncapitalised and the related expenditure is reflected in the Statement of \nProfit or Loss in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.\nSubsequent Expenditure\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future \neconomic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All \nother expenditure is recognised in Profit or Loss as an when incurred.\nUseful Economic Lives, Amortisation and Impairment\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortised using the straight-line \nmethod  to  write  down  the  cost  over  its  estimated  useful  economic  lives  \nand are generally recognised in Profit or Loss. Goodwill and intangible \nassets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised. These assets are \nassessed  for  impairment  annually  and  whenever  there  is  an  indication  \nthat the intangible asset may be impaired.\nThe period over which intangible assets are amortised is as follows;\nTable 79: Useful Lives of Intangible Assets\nClass of AssetYears\nComputer software 04 - 10\nThe above rate is consistent with the rate used in the previous years. The \namortisation  method,  useful  lives  and  residual  values  are  reviewed  at  \neach reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.\nGoodwill Arisen through Business Combination\nThe Group recognised an intangible asset by way of goodwill in respect of \nthe registered and established product portfolio, customer lists, technical \nexpertise and distribution network acquired from acquisition of the stake \nin each subsidiary which mentions in Note 4.11.1 below. The management is \nof the opinion that the brand names of the subsidiaries acquired  together \nwith its duly registered product portfolio will bring synergies to the current \nproduct  offering  of  the  Company  in  each  sector  which  it  operates    and  \nbring future economic benefits to the group.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nBased on the impairment assessment carried out by the management at \nthe reporting date, management assumed that no impairment is required \nas there is no significant change in the fair value of such acquired assets \nand liabilities, subsequent to the acquisition.\nDerecognition\nIntangible assets are derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic \nbenefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of \nthe asset, is recognised in Profit or Loss in the year the asset is derecognised.\nCarrying Value of Intangible Assets\nGroup Software  GoodwillTotal\nAs at 31st March \n2024\n2023\nRs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000\nCost\nAt the beginning of the year 150,111  916,291  1,066,402  266,222 \nAdditions during the year -    -    -    798,911 \nTransferred from capital work in progress  685,894  -    685,894  1,269 \nAt the end of the year 836,005  916,291  1,752,296  1,066,402 \nAccumulated Impairment/ amortisation\nAt the beginning of the year 136,694  -    136,694  125,549 \nAmortisation for the year (Note 4.5) 25,128  25,128  11,145 \nAt the end of the year 161,822  -    161,822  136,694 \nCarrying amount before capital work-in-progress 674,183  916,291  1,590,474  929,708 \nCapital work-in-progress at cost\nAt the beginning of the year 538,214  -    538,214  175,449 \nAdditions during the year 173,741  -    173,741  364,034 \nTransferred to Intangible assets (685,894) -    (685,894) (1,269)\nAt the end of the year 26,061  -    26,061  538,214 \nCarrying amount as at end of the year 700,244  916,291  1,616,535  1,467,922"

Any transaction cost relating to acquisition \nof investment in subsidiaries are immediately recognised in Profit or \nLoss. Following initial recognition, investments in subsidiaries are carried \nat cost less any accumulated impairment losses. The net assets of each \nsubsidiary are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there \nis  any  indication  of  impairment.  If  any  such  indication  exists,  then  the  \nrecoverable amount of the investment is estimated and the impairment \nloss is recognised to the extent of its net assets loss.\nChanges in the Group’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss \nof control are accounted for as equity transactions- that is, as transactions \nwith the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair \nvalue  of  any  consideration  paid  and  the  relevant  share  acquired  of  the  \ncarrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.\nPlease refer the Note 2.2 to the financial statements for Nature and the \nBusiness operations of the subsidiary companies.\nAccounting Estimate - Provision for Impairment\nThe  carrying  amount  of  investments  made  in  subsidiaries  are  reviewed  \nat  each  reporting  date  to  determine  whether  there  is  any  indication  of  \nimpairment.  If  any  such  indication  exists,  then  the  asset’s  recoverable  \namount   is   estimated.

Therefore, based \non an assessment made for impairment, the provision given in the Note \n4.12.1.3 was considered to be adequate as at the reporting date."

At the end \nof each reporting period all classifications are re-evaluated to the extent \nthat such classification is required and permitted.\nReceivables and debt securities issued are initially recognised when they \nare originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially \nrecognised  when  the  Company  becomes  a  party  to  the  contractual  \nprovisions of the instrument.\nA financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant \nfinancing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value \nplus transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition. \nClassification and Measurement\nBusiness Model Assessment\nThe  Company  makes  an  assessment  of  the  objective  of  the  business  \nmodel in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level, because it \nreflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to \nmanagement. The information considered includes:\n yhow the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the \nCompany’s Management;\n ythe frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior \nperiods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future \nsales activity.\nAssessment whether Contractual Cash Flows are Solely Payments \nof Principal and Interest\nFor the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair \nvalue of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as \nconsideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated \nwith the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time \nand for other basic lending risks and costs as well as a profit margin. In \nassessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of \nprincipal  and  interest,  the  Company  considers  the  contractual  terms  \nof the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset \ncontains  a  contractual  term  that  could  change  the  timing  or  amount  of  \ncontractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition.\nEquity Securities measured at FVOCI\nThe Company’s investment in equity securities are classified as Fair Value \nthrough Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI).\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, \nthe Company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the \ninvestment’s fair value in  Other Comprehensive Income. This election is \nmade on an investment-by-investment basis.\nFinancial Asset at Amortised Cost\nA financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the \nfollowing conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n yit is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to \ncollect contractual cash flows; and\n yits contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that \nare solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount \noutstanding.\nThe Group’s financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost \nare limited to its trade and other receivables, amounts due from related \nparties and cash & cash equivalents.\nSection 4 - Specific Accounting \nPolicies and Notes"

The amortised \ncost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, \nforeign  exchange  gains  and  losses  and  impairment  \nare recognised in Profit or Loss. Any gain or loss on \nderecognition is recognised in Profit or Loss\nEquity \ninvestments at \nFVOCI\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. \nDividends are recognised as income in profit or loss \nunless  the  dividend  clearly  represents  a  recovery  of  \npart of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and \nlosses are recognised in  Other Comprehensive Income \nand are never reclassified to Profit or Loss.\nDerecognition of Financial Assets\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset (or where applicable a part of \nthereof) when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset \nexpire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows \nin  a  transaction  in  which  substantially  all  of  the  risks  and  rewards  of  \nownership of the financial asset are transferred, or it neither transfers \nnor  retains  substantially  all  of  the  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  and  it  \ndoes  not  retain  control  over  the  transferred  asset.  Any  interest  in  such  \nderecognised financial assets that is created or retained by the Group is \nrecognised as a separate asset or liability.\nOn derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying \namount  of  the  asset  (or  the  carrying  amount  allocated  to  the  portion  \nof  the  asset  derecognised)  and  the  sum  of  the  consideration  received  \n(including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and any \ncumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in Other Comprehensive \nIncome is recognised in Profit or Loss.\nFinancial liabilities\nInitial Recognition and Measurement\nFinancial  liabilities  are  classified  as  measured  at  amortised  cost  or \nFVTPL. A financial liability is classified as FVTPL if it is classified as held \n- for - trading at the initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are \nmeasured at fair value and any resulting gains and losses, including any \ninterest expense, are recognised in Profit or Loss. \nThe Group classifies financial liabilities at initial recognition as other \nfinancial liabilities. At the end of each reporting period all classifications \nare re-evaluated to the extent that such classification is permitted and \nrequired.\nAll the financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less any \ndirectly attributable transaction costs. Other financial liabilities mainly \nconsist of trade payables and bank borrowings.\nSubsequent Measurement\nOther financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost. \nInterest  expense  and  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  are  recognised  \nin profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in \nProfit or Loss.\nThe amortised cost of a financial liability is the amount at which the \nfinancial  liability  is  measured  at  initial  recognition,  minus  principal \nrepayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective \ninterest method minus any reduction for impairment.\nDetails of financial liabilities recognised in the Statement of Financial \nPosition are given in Notes 4.22 and 4.27 on page 225 and 236.\nDerecognition\nThe  Group  derecognises  a  financial  liability  when  its  contractual \nobligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.\nOffsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount \npresented in the Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, \nthe Group currently has a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts \nand intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and \nsettle the liability simultaneously."

The  Group's  risk  \nmanagement process identifies and analyses the risks it faces, establishes \nappropriate  risk  limits  and  controls,  and  monitors  and  manages  events  \nthat could have a substantial impact on capital and earnings.\nThe  overall  objectives  and  policies  for  the  Group’s  financial  risk \nmanagement are as per the internal treasury practices. It will cover foreign \nexchange policy, investment policy, financing policy and policies on credit \nrisk and risk limits.\nThe  Group  audit  committee  is  assisted  in  its  oversight  role  by  internal  \naudit.  Internal  audit  undertakes  both  regular  and  ad  hoc  reviews  of  risk  \nmanagement  controls  and  procedures,  the  results  of  which  are  reported  \nto the audit committee. Further details of management of risk is available \nfrom page 120 to 126.\n(a) Market Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial \ninstrument  will  fluctuate  because  of  changes  in  market  prices,  such \nas  foreign  exchange  rates,  interest  rates  and  equity  prices,  which  will  \naffect the Group’s profit or loss or the value of its holdings of financial \ninstruments.  The  objective  of  market  risk  management  is  to  manage  \nand  control  market  risk  exposures  within  acceptable  parameters,  while  \noptimising the return."

The  Group’s  Financial  Statements  \nwhich are presented in LKR, are affected by foreign exchange fluctuations \nthrough both translation risk and transaction risk.\nAs at 31st March 2024, rupee appreciated by 9% against the US dollar \ncompared to its closing rate on 31st March 2023. Apart from the currency \nappreciation  there  were  some  improvements  in  foreign  currency  market  \ndue  to  the  improved  market  liquidity.  Most  of  the  import  restrictions  \nwere lifted and margin requirements for certain imports were withdrawn. \nHowever the volatility of the rupee can be expected once the foreign debt \nrepayment commences and import restrictions are fully lifted.

With the conscious \nstrategy of the Group to preserve foreign currency cash balances and the \ndecision to invoice certain customers in foreign currency, Group managed \nto  create  natural  hedges  to  the  extent  possible  mitigating  the  foreign  \ncurrency risk.\nThe overall objective of currency risk management is to reduce the short-\nterm negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash \nflow, thereby increasing the predictability of the financial results.\nThe  following  table  demonstrates Group exposure to currency risk as at \nthe reporting date.\nSensitivity Analysis - Based on Exchange Rate Fluctuation \nThe main foreign currencies that the Group transacts in are the US dollar \nand  the  Euro.

The Group mainly borrows in the short term to fund its working capital \nrequirements which are mostly linked to floating interest rates based on \nAWPLR. For Long Term funding needs the Group maintains an appropriate \nmix of fixed and floating interest rates. Cap & floor arrangements are also \nnegotiated wherever appropriate for Long Term Borrowings on floating \nrates. Group Treasury closely monitors the interest rate fluctuations in the \nmarket and negotiates favourable rates on borrowing to manage interest \nrate risk.\nThe interest rate profile of the Group’s long-term borrowings are disclosed \nin the Note 4.22.1.2\nSensitivity Analysis\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of term loans and borrowings affected. \nWith all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings as follows: \nImpact to the Profitability\nGroupCompany\n2024202320242023\nRs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000\nLKR borrowings \nIncrease in 300 Basis Points * (78,940) (46,590) (69,224) (36,776)\nDecrease in 300 Basis Points * 78,940  46,590  69,224  36,776 \n*The  spread  of  basis  points  for  the  interest  rate  sensitivity  analysis  is  \nassumed based on movement of base floating interest rates in the market \nduring financial year 2023/24.\n(iii) Equity Price Risk\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  equity  price  risk  because  of  investments  in  \nquoted shares held by the Group classified as Equity instruments at FVOCI.\nThe  value  of  these  investments  is  subjected  to  the  performance  of  \ninvestee  company  and  the  factors  that  affects  the  status  of  the  stock  \nmarket. The Group manages the equity price risk through diversification \nand  by  placing  limits  on  individual  and  total  equity  instruments.  The  \nBoard of Directors reviews and approves all equity investment decisions. \nSensitivity analysis on the value of the investments is not provided as it is \ndeemed to be not material.\n(b) Credit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or \ncounterparty  to  a  financial  instrument  fails  to  meet  its  contractual \nobligations, and arises principally from Group’s trade receivables.\nThe Group has taken several measures to manage and mitigate the credit \nrisk including carrying out a credit evaluation as per the Group credit policy, \nprior to extending credit. A review of age analysis of trade receivables and \nfollow-up meetings are carried out by the business unit managers at least \nonce a month and by the Group Management Committee (GMC) at least \nonce a quarter. In the event of a debt becoming doubtful, legal action is \ninitiated by the Manager-Legal.\nThe  Group  has  taken  necessary  steps  to  monitor  creditors  more  closely  \nand frequently to ensure that the payables are settled on time. \nCredit Risk Exposure\nThe maximum risk exposure of financial assets which are generally subject to credit risk are equal to their carrying amounts.

Other financial \nnature  receivables  are  recognised  as  other  receivables.  If  collection  is  \nexpected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, \nthey are presented as non-current assets.\nTrade  and  other  receivables  are  recognised  initially  at  fair  value  and  \nsubsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  \nmethod, less provision for impairment.\nAccounting Estimate - Provision for Impairment\nGroup makes impairment for receivables based on the simplified approach \nto provide for Expected Credit Losses (ECLs) as per SLFRS 9, which permits \nthe use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. \nMeasurement of ECLs\nECLs  are  a  probability-weighted  estimate  of  credit  losses.  Credit  losses  \nare measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference \nbetween the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract \nand the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). ECLs are \ndiscounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\nThe   allowance   is   provided   by   considering   evidence   of   impairment   \nfor  receivables  at  both  an  individual  asset  and  at  a  collective  level.  \nAll  individually  significant  receivables  are  individually  assessed  for \nimpairment   by   considering   objective   evidence   i.e.   experiencing   a   \nsignificant financial difficulty or default in payments by a customer. All \nindividually insignificant debtors and based on management judgment, \nsimilar risk characteristic debtors that are not specifically impaired are \nthen  collectively  assessed  for  any  impairment  that  has  been  incurred  \nbut not yet identified by grouping them together based on similar risk \ncharacteristics.\nIn assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical information \non  the  probability  of  default,  the  timing  of  recoveries,  and  the  amount  \nof loss incurred, and makes an adjustment if current and forward looking \neconomic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are likely \nto be greater or lesser than suggested historical trends.\nCarrying Value of Trade and Other Receivables\nGroupCompany\nAs at 31st March2024202320242023\nRs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000\nTrade receivables 12,307,083  7,498,737  7,474,668  4,896,675 \nProvision for impairment (Note 4.16.1) (1,132,245) (1,208,924) (900,381) (1,013,647)\n 11,174,838  6,289,813  6,574,287  3,883,028 \nOther receivables 10,973  13,114  8,592  9,135 \nDeposits 445,122  1,057,143  381,105  203,058 \n 11,630,934  7,360,070  6,963,984  4,095,221 \n4.16.1  Movement in Provision for Impairment of Trade Receivables\nGroupCompany\nAs at 31st March2024202320242023\nRs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000\nAt the beginning of the year1,208,924 1,135,298  1,013,647  895,436 \nAdditions through subsidiaries -    3,360  -    -   \nProvision made during the year (Note 4.16.1.1) 105,241  79,680  50,790  124,838 \nWrite-off during the year (181,920) (9,414) (164,056) (6,627)\nAt the end of the year 1,132,245  1,208,924  900,381  1,013,647 \nTrade receivables which were written off during the year are not subject to any of enforcement activity."

A contract is, or contains a lease, if the contract conveys \nthe right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in \nexchange  for  a  consideration.  To  assess  whether  a  contract  conveys  the  \nright to control the use of an identified asset, the Group uses the definition \nof a lease in SLFRS 16. \nThe  lease  liability  is  initially  measured  at  the  present  value  of  the  lease  \npayments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using \nthe  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease  or,  if  that  rate  cannot  be  readily  \ndetermined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group \nuses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\nThe  lease  liability  is  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  \ninterest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease \npayments arising from a change in an index or rate. \n4.22.3.1  Movement of Lease Liabilities\nGroupCompany\nAs at 31st March2024202320242023\nRs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000Rs.‘000\nCost\nAt the beginning of the year 773,680  679,583  533,412  583,888 \nAdditions during the year 74,340  197,402  37,995  34,541 \nAccretion of interest (Note 4.4) 77,145  67,558  52,620  56,569 \nDerecognition of lease agreements during the year(16,524) (165,222) (12,910) (135,942)\nPayments to lease creditors(212,162) (5,644)(144,972) (5,644)\nEffect of movements in exchange rates(19,639) 3  -    - \nAt the end of the year 676,839  773,680  466,143  533,412 \nLease liabilities presented in Statement of Financial Position as follows;\nClassified as non current liabilities  517,967  348,696  373,096  135,685 \nClassified as current liabilities  158,872  424,984  93,047  397,727 \n 676,839  773,680  466,143  533,412 \nMaturity Analysis of lease payments\n - Less than 1 year 158,872  424,984  93,047  397,727 \n - 1 to 5 year 370,488  189,297  250,486  135,685 \n - More than 5 years 147,479  159,399  122,610  -   \n 676,839  773,680  466,143  533,412 \nInterest recognised in net finance cost (Note 4.4)77,14567,55852,62056,569\nDepreciation of right-of-use assets recognised in administrative expenses (Note 4.5)155,680146,015107,498113,020\nThe Group and the Company had total cash outflows for leases of Rs. 212.7 million and Rs. 145 million in 2023/24.

These  obligations  come  within  the  scope  of  a  defined \ncontribution plan as per LKAS -19 on ‘Employee Benefits’. Obligations for \ncontributions to defined contribution plans are recognised in Profit or Loss \nas the related service is provided.\nDefined benefit obligation\nIn  accordance  with  the  Gratuity  Act  No.  12  of  1983,  a  liability  arises  for  a  \ndefined benefit obligation to employees.\nSuch defined benefit obligation is a post-employment benefit obligation \nfalling  within  the  scope  of  Sri  Lanka  Accounting  Standard  LKAS  -19  on  \n‘Employee Benefits’.\nThe liability recognised in the Statement of Financial Position is the \npresent value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date. The \ncalculation is performed annually by Mr. Poopalanathan Messer. Actuarial & \nManagement Consultants (Private) Limited, firm of professionally  qualified \nactuary using the Projected Unit Credit method (PUC). Remeasurement of \nthe defined benefit liability, which comprises actuarial gains and losses \nare recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income. The Group \nrecognises the increase in defined benefit liability attributable to the \nservices  provided  by  employees  during  the  year  (current  service  cost)  \nin Profit or Loss together with the interest expenses. In the absence of a \ndeep market in long term corporate bonds in Sri Lanka, the discount rate \nhas been derived, and approximation of a long term interest rate of 13%  \n(2022/23 - 19%) has been used to discount future liabilities.\nThe liability is not externally funded.\nAccounting Estimate\nThe  actuarial  valuation  involves  making  assumptions  about  discount  \nrates,  future  salary  increases  and  mortality  rates.  The  complexity  of  \nthe  valuation,  the  underlying  assumptions  and  its  long  term  nature,  \nthe defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these \nassumptions.

A  deferred  tax  asset  is  \nrecognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits \nwill be available against which they can be used.\nDeferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced \nto the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will \nbe  realised;  such  reductions  are  reversed  when  the  probability  of  future  \ntaxable profits improves. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed \nat  each  reporting  date  and  recognised  to  the  extent  that  it  has  become  \nprobable that future taxable profits will be available against which they \ncan be used.\nDeferred  tax  assets  and  deferred  tax  liabilities  are  offset,  if  a  legally  \nenforceable  right  exists  to  set  off  current  tax  assets  against  current  tax  \nliabilities and when the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity \nand the same taxation authority.\nAccounting Estimate\nDeferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax losses to the extent \nthat it is probable that future taxable profits will be available and can be \nutilised against such tax losses. Judgement is required to determine the \namount  of  deferred  tax  assets  that  can  be  recognised,  based  upon  the  \nlikely timing and level of future taxable profits, together with future tax-\nplanning strategies.\nRecoverability of Temporary Difference Arising from Tax Losses\nAs  at  31st  March  2024,  the  Group  has  recognised  Rs.  2,010.4  million  \n(2022/23-  Rs.  1,719.4  million)  as  a  deferred  tax  assets  on  the  deductible  \ntemporary differences arising from tax losses, defined benefit obligations, \nobsolete  stocks,  debtor  impairment,  free  service  provision,  Customer  \nIncentives, SLFRS adjustments on Leases and warranty provision. \nAccording  to  the  Group  policy,  deferred  tax  asset  is  recognised  only  to  \nthe extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available \nagainst  which  they  can  be  used.  In  the  back  ground  of  the  Business  \nContinuity Plans in place, the Board of Directors has assessed the current \neconomic implications  on the Group and is of the view that future taxable \nprofit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax \ncredits can be utilised."

Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be \nreimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement \nis  recognised  as  a  separate  asset  but  only  when  the  reimbursement  is  \nvirtually  certain.  The  expense  relating  to  any  provision  is  presented  in  \nProfit or Loss net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of \nmoney is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate \nthat reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where \ndiscounting  is  used,  the  increase  in  the  provision  due  to  the  passage  of  \ntime is recognised as a finance cost.\nProvisions are calculated based on the historical experience and the \nspecific terms in the individual cases. The Group arrives at an estimate on \nthe basis of an evaluation of the most likely outcome.\nAll known provisions have been accounted for in preparing these Financial \nStatements.\n4.26.2  Warranty Provisions \nThe  provision  for  warranty  relates  mainly  to  vehicles  sold  for  which  the  \nCompany gives warranty commencing from the date of sale. The warranty \nreceived by manufacturer is effective from date of shipment. This causes \na time window during which the Company is exposed to warranty liability. \nA provision for warranty is recognised to cover such exposure to a liability. \nThe  provision  is  based  on  the  historical  warranty  data  and  a  weighting  \nof  possible  outcomes  against  their  associated  probabilities.  The  said  \nwarranty provision will be reversed upon expiration of the warranty period."
